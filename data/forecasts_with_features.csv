2018-02-28,boards,"today and definitely the potential exists for almost nation-wide disruptions by Thursday night and Friday. Heavy snow, blowing snow, and severe cold from wind chill values near -10 C are all part of the developing situation. Conditions today will vary considerably both from one hour to the next, and from one location to another, as snow streamers can develop with gaps between them, sometimes caused by upstream land masses like Wales or the Isle of Man limiting the ""fetch"" over open water. However, the best bet is to assume that travel in warned areas could be very disrupted even if your locality seems okay. Further afield, it shouldn't be too difficult to get around today in some parts of the west and southwest, but check all sources such as weather forum reports, to get a clear picture of how things are evolving if you need to travel, because in some places, we could foresee road travel coming to a halt and people being stranded in the heavier snowfall areas.

FORECASTS: 

TODAY will be exceptionally cold and by afternoon very windy at times (easterly 50-90 km/hr with some variations in direction between southeast and northeast). Heavy snow will redevelop after a brief morning pause, and blizzard conditions are quite possible in parts of Leinster and near the south coast into Cork. (Cork city may be on the edge of that much of the day) ... A further 20 to 40 cm of snow could fall in some places around Dublin, Kildare, Laois, Carlow, Wicklow and Meath, and 15 to 30 cm in Louth and Ulster, parts of Westmeath and Wexford. Falls further west of about 10 to 20 cm are possible, but amounts should taper down to small values (1 to 4 cm) near Atlantic coasts. Blowing snow especially by afternoon may cause zero visibility in blizzard-like conditions. Temperatures will be held down to the range of -2 to +1 C and inland may fall further during heavier snowfalls. Thunder-snow could be frequent in Leinster and occasional elsewhere.","today|and|definit|the|potenti|exist|for|almost|nation-wid|disrupt|by|thursday|night|and|friday|heavi|snow|,|blow|snow|,|and|sever|cold|from|wind|chill|valu|near|-10|c|are|all|part|of|the|develop|situat|condit|today|will|vari|consider|both|from|one|hour|to|the|next|,|and|from|one|locat|to|anoth|,|as|snow|streamer|can|develop|with|gap|between|them|,|sometim|caus|by|upstream|land|mass|like|wale|or|the|isl|of|man|limit|the|``|fetch|''|over|open|water|howev|,|the|best|bet|is|to|assum|that|travel|in|warn|area|could|be|veri|disrupt|even|if|your|local|seem|okay|further|afield|,|it|should|n't|be|too|difficult|to|get|around|today|in|some|part|of|the|west|and|southwest|,|but|check|all|sourc|such|as|weather|forum|report|,|to|get|a|clear|pictur|of|how|thing|are|evolv|if|you|need|to|travel|,|becaus|in|some|place|,|we|could|forese|road|travel|come|to|a|halt|and|peopl|be|strand|in|the|heavier|snowfal|area|forecast|:|today|will|be|except|cold|and|by|afternoon|veri|windi|at|time|(|easterli|50-90|km/hr|with|some|variat|in|direct|between|southeast|and|northeast|)|.|heavi|snow|will|redevelop|after|a|brief|morn|paus|,|and|blizzard|condit|are|quit|possibl|in|part|of|leinster|and|near|the|south|coast|into|cork|(|cork|citi|may|be|on|the|edg|of|that|much|of|the|day|)|...|a|further|20|to|40|cm|of|snow|could|fall|in|some|place|around|dublin|,|kildar|,|laoi|,|carlow|,|wicklow|and|meath|,|and|15|to|30|cm|in|louth|and|ulster|,|part|of|westmeath|and|wexford|fall|further|west|of|about|10|to|20|cm|are|possibl|,|but|amount|should|taper|down|to|small|valu|(|1|to|4|cm|)|near|atlant|coast|blow|snow|especi|by|afternoon|may|caus|zero|visibl|in|blizzard-lik|condit|temperatur|will|be|held|down|to|the|rang|of|-2|to|+1|c|and|inland|may|fall|further|dure|heavier|snowfal|thunder-snow|could|be|frequent|in|leinster|and|occasion|elsewher|.",WET|COLD|SUNNY

Further accumulations will therefore vary over a large range, your best bet is to double what you have already had from mid-day yesterday at your location -- this may be anywhere from 2-5 cm in light snow areas, to 30 to 50 cm in heavy snow zones. Winds near the east coast will be easterly 70 to 100 km/hr and these strong winds are making considerable progress inland in central regions, where snow has been heavy, severe blowing and drifting has already begun and will continue. Near the south coast, winds are likely to fluctuate more between 40 and 70 km/hr and drifting will be more moderate. Low snowfall zones will also tend to be sheltered from strong winds (there may be exceptions near boundaries between heavy and light snow). And to complicate matters further, parts of the north will remain almost snow-free while other places get sudden blasts of snow from streamers that are affecting parts of east Ulster.

Local flooding is likely to develop, poor driving conditions may be encountered due to surface water on some major routes and hydroplaning and road spray hazards.

These winds will slowly abate for a time after mid-day as the low pressure trough approaches. Rather variable and sometimes light winds at first in western counties will rapidly increase this afternoon to west-northwest 80-120 km/hr for several hours. These very strong winds will move along the south coast from Cork (around 3 p.m.) to Wexford (by 5 p.m.) and will then rapidly overspread all other counties further north once the low reaches the Irish Sea by evening. Highs will reach 13 C in parts of the south and southeast, 8 to 10 C most other places.
