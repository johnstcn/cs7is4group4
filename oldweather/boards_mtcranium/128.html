Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Partly cloudy with some decent sunny intervals in south and east, followed by more widespread showers, some rather heavy, but average amounts 5-8 mm, highs 7 to 9 C. Occasionally breezy, westerly 50 to 80 km/hr, in some exposed coastal areas.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain becoming somewhat heavier in the south, 5 to 10 mm likely, cloudy with occasional showers further north. Lows 4 to 7 C.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Intervals of rain, gusty southwest to west winds mainly near south coast, highs near 10 C. Some localized heavier rainfalls with complex frontal wave pattern, most likely near south coast in morning, then redeveloping further north in some central counties by evening. Total rainfalls about 5 to 15 mm.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Breezy, a few showers or occasional light rain, highs near 10 C. Some strong gusts possible near south coast, and possibility of a frontal boundary developing east-west through central Ireland, highs only 4 to 7 C north of that. Likely not quite cold enough for snow or sleet to develop except possibly on a few high summits in the north.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Showers, or intervals of light rain, highs near 9 C. Moderate southwest to west winds veering to northwest then north as the day progresses. Partial clearing by afternoon, then turning somewhat colder by evening.<br />
<br />
MONDAY (Christmas Eve) ... Some rain may linger across the south for part of the day, but it should clear away by afternoon. The north is more likely to be dry all day, as winds turn slightly northeasterly then become light and variable as weak pressure systems drift past, followed by higher pressure by the night of 24th-25th. Quite cold by evening after highs of 7 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY (Christmas Day) ... A dry day is expected, with some scattered frost and mist greeting early risers, morning lows reaching -2 to +3 C, to be followed by some hazy sunshine where the mist dissipates. Although western counties and some coastal regions will become quite mild, a colder day may persist inland as an inversion develops and some places may have mist or low cloud all day. Highs therefore may be in a fairly large range from 6 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... This higher pressure will hang around for several days, with mild southerly winds in western counties and near the south coast, possibly spreading more inland too eventually, but the 26th could also continue misty to foggy inland and therefore remain a bit chilly in places. Eventually, another weak frontal system will push this high back to the east and return some light rain in mild southwest winds. There is the caveat that a major change in pattern is expected at some point within one to three weeks as many signs are now pointing to a &quot;stratospheric warming&quot; event which is usually a precursor of high pressure further north, blocking and colder weather. Models may not give us all the details two or three weeks ahead of this change so while they continue to show a rather bland pattern into the new year, it's quite possible that reality will change that. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday was cloudy but very mild, with highs reaching 7 C (that is considered very mild here). We have another strong Pacific storm approaching with wind and rain for Thursday, in fact severe winds predicted near the coasts. This is a much stronger system than the one that freakishly created the tornado on Tuesday but I'm betting this one won't do that. Another strong storm system is forming over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. If there were more cold air in place this could be a heavy snowfall producer further north, but it's going to be too mild for snow except above 2,000 feet in the Blue Ridge Mountains and into central PA and parts of western NY. Heavy rain and strong south winds will hit NYC and New England by Friday. It could be as warm as 17 C for a brief period in those regions before turning colder over the weekend. This storm is heading for the west coast of Greenland and it may play a role in the pattern change expected fairly soon, as the very mild air heads up towards Greenland along with it.</div>

<br />
Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rather windy near the south coast, winds southwest 50 to 80 km/hr, but these winds should ease later. Some scattered outbreaks of light rain but fairly dry overall this morning, then somewhat more widespread light rain in central regions by afternoon, only 3 to 7 mm further rainfall expected at most. Highs 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Foggy with some light rain, lows 3 to 6 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Variable cloud, some isolated showers or patchy light rain, highs 8 to 10 C, except 6 to 8 C in some parts of the north. Breezy at times, southwest to west 40 to 70 km/hr.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Rain becoming widespread and rather heavy at times, 10 to 15 mm likely in some southern and central counties, not as much further north. Lows near 7 C and highs near 10 C. Moderate southwest to west winds turning more northwesterly during the afternoon.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Some partial clearing, turning a bit colder in north, also a few leftover showers will drift slowly north while dying out entirely by about early afternoon, hazy sunshine in some places by afternoon. Lows 2 to 5 C and highs 8 to 10 C.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY (Christmas Day) ... Hazy or foggy during the morning, rather cold inland, lows -1 to +4 C. Increasing cloud during the day, some lingering fog or mist, but also some sunny breaks in east. Rain will approach the west coast, but it may not move very far inland, as winds remain moderate southerly during the afternoon near west coast. Highs 7 to 11 C (mildest near south and west coasts).<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY and THURSDAY 26th-27th will remain similar with high pressure to the east having some influence in Leinster and east Munster, keeping rain largely out in the western counties (or near the west coast at times), so a chance of it staying relatively dry in a good portion of the country, with light rain in the west about 70&#37; likely, but amounts not very large. Winds southerly for most of this interval, 40 to 60 km/hr at times. Lows 2 to 6 C and highs 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... The models keep churning out similar looking days with weak frontal systems, and no real return to the vigorous stormy pattern of last week, but some signs would suggest caution in going too far down the road as a pattern change could begin to develop in early January. Eventually it seems likely to turn significantly colder, but timing is uncertain, will say 10-15 January perhaps the most likely time for this change to set in (could be earlier or later by equal chances). <br />
<br />
My local weather on Thursday was very windy from the south at times with rain that ended by mid-afternoon. We are expecting a return blast from the north later tonight as a cold front is moving through now, after highs near 4 C. This proved to be an intense winter storm system which produced wind damage around the Vancouver region with some gusts over 120 km/hr. It is rapidly weakening as it moves inland, meanwhile, lots of rain in eastern portions of the U.S. from a strong low moving north out of Georgia. This will continue all day Friday in most of the large cities on the eastern seaboard and up into the eastern Great Lakes region also. <br />
<br />
Notes: The winter solstice occurs today at 22:24 hours (10:24 p.m.) and the full moon is timed for Saturday at 17:50 hours (5:50 p.m.).</div>

<br />
Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Partly cloudy this morning, a few brief showers widely separated, then more overcast by afternoon, highs 7 to 11 C, coolest in north central counties. Moderate southwest breezes at times near south and west coasts. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Cloudy, becoming foggy after midnight, some light to moderate rain moving into western counties. Lows 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Overcast, foggy or misty, 10 to 20 mm rainfalls likely, some moderate southwest winds in the morning veering more to northwest by afternoon and evening. Highs 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Variable cloud with some sunshine, more likely in north Leinster and Ulster, as leftover light rain tapers to drizzle before ending as mist or fog in some south central counties. Light winds, some northeast breezes at times in Ulster. Rather chilly in north, staying rather mild in the south. Lows -1 to +4 C, highs 6 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY (Christmas Day) ... Fog or mist rather widespread in the morning, a few areas may be rather cold where skies remain clear, but lows will vary from near freezing to almost 10 C in some coastal areas, then daytime highs may struggle to reach 8 C inland but could top off around 12 C near west coast. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... High pressure looks set to remain in place over Britain and northern France all week until at least New Years, and Ireland will remain in a light southerly flow that will keep temperatures fairly mild for most, although with some risk of frost and fog developing in the east (as is also more likely for Britain under a slack wind gradient). Some rain will graze the west coast around 26th-27th but it may only make it a few miles past a Belmullet to Clifden line before dying out, so most will have extensive dry intervals of weather during the holiday period. Temperatures should be reasonably mild, probably very mild near west coast (12-14 C) but more variable inland and east coast due in part to the slack wind gradient that won't mix the air very efficiently during the day, so if the nights get rather cold that colder air could linger under low cloud or fog especially. You may find in fact that all of these conditions will be encountered within short distances, valleys are more prone to cold and low cloud lingering than coasts or higher terrain in these patterns. <br />
<br />
There is also the background trend to consider that eventually, this stagnant high could swell up and start moving northwest in response to changes in the upper levels, and that could bring on a more widespread cold spell early in the new year. However, this may be delayed for a week or two, the widely predicted stratospheric events have not actually happened yet. <br />
<br />
My local weather turned rather nice for a change, as Thursday's storm moved away by Friday morning, leaving us under sunny skies and moderate northwest winds, highs near 4 C. A somewhat colder air mass is settling in and some light snow seems likely around here on the weekend, with more rain and gusty winds on the coast. The east coast storm has moved through the inland northeast U.S. and is now passing east of Lake Ontario into western Quebec province on its way to Baffin Island eventually. Record high temperatures were widespread in the eastern U.S. (typically they were around 18-20 C and many of them eclipsed 1957 records). Weather buffs will recognize that 1957-58 was a very strong El Nino winter although also the strongest sunspot producing winter of modern times.</div>

<br />
Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... One further interval of rain will develop across the west-central counties this morning and will drift to the southeast by mid-day, bringing another 5 to 10 mm of rain. Some clearing will develop gradually elsewhere, and in all areas by later afternoon, and it will become rather breezy at times from the northwest, with slowly falling temperatures as a result. Highs 8 to 11 C for most, 6 to 8 C in parts of Ulster.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Some isolated showers, or drizzle, with fog or mist rather widespread, turning quite cold in north and east, lows -1 to +3 C. Under overcast skies, rather mild in south and west, lows 4 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... A few sunny intervals will develop in the north and east, with mostly cloudy skies and isolated showers or patchy drizzle in the south and west, although here it will begin to clear eventually too. Highs 4 to 7 C north and east, but 8 to 11 C in south and west. Light winds becoming northeast then easterly.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY (Christmas Day) ... A misty or foggy start in many areas, and low cloud could persist for a good part of the morning before some hazy sunshine develops by afternoon. Quite mild except in a few parts of the inland east and north, highs generally 11 to 14 C but could be held down to 7 C in a few places by persistent low cloud. Light to moderate southerly winds. Some light rain could brush parts of northwest Mayo but otherwise mostly dry.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY (St Stephen's Day) ... Misty or hazy, some sun at times, mild. Isolated outbreaks of light rain in northwest. Lows 4 to 7 C and highs 10 to 13 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... High pressure will remain the dominant weather control feature most of the time until beyond New Years, with just brief and weak frontal bands rippling through, around Friday 28th and Sunday 30th, each bringing a little light rain and moderate westerly winds. The high pressure will quickly redevelop after each of those episodes, and each day will bring somewhat lower temperatures both by day and overnight, but in the range of 8 to 11 C by day and 2 to 6 C overnight, with isolated frost possible eventually if skies clear. The high will not be totally overcast but will likely have more cloud than clear breaks, for most, with the best chance of sunshine in coastal west Munster and Connacht. Eventually, this rather slack weather pattern will break down as strong west to northwest winds develop in early January and much colder air will begin to push south around the 4th to 7th of January, with a slow decline in temperatures, reaching values like 4 or 5 C in the daytime and -3 C at night, and perhaps it won't just end that that modified form of wintry conditions, but guidance becomes rather &quot;low confidence&quot; after two weeks especially in this situation where a major pattern shift seems quite possible. <br />
<br />
My local weather turned a lot colder on Saturday, with a daytime high of -4 C and some light snow developing by evening after a dry and partly cloudy day. <br />
<br />
Christmas forecast schedule -- I hope to be able to update forecasts on almost the normal timetable, as we have no travel plans until after the 28th. We may have some guest forecasting near the end of the month. If you're checking out for the holidays, Merry Christmas, and if your absence will be prolonged, happy new year.</div>

TODAY ... Mostly cloudy, a few brighter intervals may develop by afternoon, as rather extensive fog and mist will be slow to clear, and when they do so, higher cloud layers are over top anyway. Rather cold in Ulster and east Connacht, much of Leinster, but warming up gradually to reach about 7 or 8 C. Staying milder in Munster and south, west Connacht, light rain at times, but as this spreads back to the north, it will be dying out gradually too. Highs 10 to 12 C. Generally light winds from an easterly direction.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Mist or fog likely, most places should remain quite mild around 7 to 9 C, a few clear spots could drop several degrees below that. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY (Christmas Day) ... I hope you're not finding out it's Christmas Day from me, or the weather will be the least of your concerns. Anyway, it should be quite bland, rather mild and in some parts of the west drizzly at times, with highs near 13 C. Further east, mostly cloudy, the odd glimpse of the sun perhaps, and 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY (St Stephen's Day) ... Mostly cloudy, mild, lows near 6 C and highs near 11 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY and FRIDAY will continue cloudy and mild, with some light rain advancing slowly inland from coastal Connacht, tending to break up once it moves inland. Some parts of the east and south may remain largely dry. Lows near 4 C and highs near 10 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... A very gradual trend towards colder weather appears likely as the high pressure rebuilds after weak fronts pass during the weekend of 29-30 December, with only slight changes in the weather as a result, then mixtures of cloud and sunshine as the high parks almost overhead by New Years, with a high barometric pressure expected near 1045 millibars. This may be a step towards a pattern change where the high drifts even further northwest and begins to interact with oncoming colder air from the northeast, promoting a colder regime after about the 4th of January. This transitional stage may feature some slight frosts returning in early January and highs only 5 to 8 C.<br />
<br />
My local weather was very seasonal bringing a light but solid snow cover of 3 cms, which should stick around for the week as temperatures will be dropping below freezing. The high on Sunday was -2 C. The weather pattern has lost all of the bluster that it had last week, with weak systems pushing onto the west coast but running out of milder Pacific air as soon as they try to move inland. This is pushing most of the snow expected this coming week into the western U.S., then further east, it's a dry and seasonably cold pattern with very little happening, at least it makes it easy to travel over this holiday season. <br />
<br />
Once again, merry Christmas to those still looking in, I will post some brief updates for the next few days. We aren't doing very much here until a few days after the 25th, when a brief trip to see family on the coast is planned, then should be back home just in time for New Years.</div>

Forecast update</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone reading the forecast today is probably a &quot;hard core&quot; weather enthusiast so I will make this a bit more of a blog than a forecast ...<br />
<br />
... looking over the recent observations, Dublin is considerably colder than the rest of the country (4 deg at 0600h), and there may be some patchy dense fog in the region. The rest of the country will be overcast with mist and generally less dense fog except on some hills possibly, and it will be mild, 11 to 13 C. This sort of weather is likely to continue with little change through Thursday 27th, generally mild, sometimes foggy and in a few spots, drizzle will fall. Heavier rain is moving around the marine areas west of Ireland today and tomorrow, not likely to make much impact on land except possibly around northwest Mayo and coastal Donegal. By Friday, a more organized push of rain will move through the north and central counties but it will be losing ground as it moves east, with amounts of 5 to 10 mm the top end of what's likely to fall. This will lead to somewhat more broken overcast skies in more of a westerly wind by Saturday. Each day will continue rather mild with highs 9 to 12 C. By Sunday, another weak disturbance will drift through Ulster with light rain or drizzle in places, but then higher pressure will slowly build up again, reaching a peak around 2-4 January. As this happens, it's possible that the high will begin to chill especially if it's not entirely overcast, and this could lead to some patchy dense fog and heavy frost in places by the early part of January, then we can expect some sort of gradual change to a colder regime in northerly winds as this high appears destined to drift further west and promote the northerly flow. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Monday has been overcast, we ended up with 10 cms of snow on the ground and a few flakes drifting down at times but no added depth as a result, and our temperatures are close to -4 C. <br />
<br />
Hope you're having an enjoyable Christmas Day and look for an update tomorrow morning.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY... Cloudy with a few brighter intervals, mild. Some mist or fog in a few places and also a bit of drizzle or light rain near northwest coast. Highs 11 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Fog or mist developing, generally quite mild, lows 7 to 10 C. A few locations inland east could drop a few degrees below that range if skies cleared. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Overcast, mild. Some rain moving into north and west by evening. Highs 12 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, as showers move east, somewhat breezy, lows near 7 C and highs near 11 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... The mild spell will begin to break down around or shortly after New Years, as high pressure rebuilds and repositions itself further north. This could allow for clearing skies which will certainly make the nights a lot colder (as they are presently under the high in France and Germany). Days would also be cooler than this current mild spell. Then there are some mixed signs of colder air still moving south in the first week to ten days of January. <br />
<br />
My local weather remained cloudy and rather cold (I think, never went outside, but the snow hasn't melted) ... at around -1 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Misty with some lingering fog, also the occasional brighter interval especially near some coasts. Light rain off the west coast will begin to overspread north Connacht and west Ulster this afternoon and evening, amounts slight (2 to 5 mm by morning). Highs 9 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Some outbreaks of light rain or drizzle, otherwise foggy or misty, mild. Lows 7 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, mild. Highs 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Increasing cloud during the morning, some outbreaks of light rain mostly in north, lows 2 to 5 C and highs 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, lows 3 to 7 C and highs 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Around New Years Eve into early January, the European high will probably begin to swell up and reposition near Scotland with an extension into Greenland. This will likely have the effect of dropping temperatures gradually in Ireland, until some slight frosts begin to occur under partly clear skies at night, and daytime highs fall to about 7 C. Models are then divided on what happens next, some indicating this modified cold will continue, some suggesting a deeper cold on northeast winds, and one source saying the episode will be brief and the Atlantic will resume control. With the upper levels likely to undergo profound changes soon, anything is possible, would at least prepare for the possibility of more significant cold weather than the early transitional period, but timing it is a challenge. The interval 4 to 7 January is about the earliest it might appear, but 7 to 15 January probably more likely. <br />
<br />
My local weather has been remarkably quiet recently, just overcast with nothing much happening within hundreds of miles, as the Pacific (our version of the Atlantic, bigger with mighty big muscles at times) has taken a nap. For this location and time of year, it's not particularly cold but just cold enough to preserve our thin snow cover at 3-5 cm. (high of about 0.5 C). Very cold air has been locked up in the high arctic for the time being, -45 C readings at some places in the northern arctic islands. But not much of that seems inclined to head south at this point.</div>

TODAY ... Cloudy with some sunny breaks developing mid-day and afternoon, very mild. Highs 12 to 14 C. <br />

TONIGHT ... Overcast, some light rain in parts of the north, very mild. Lows 8 to 11 C. <br />

<br />
TUESDAY (New Years Day) ... Partly to mostly cloudy, lows near 4 C and highs near 8 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... We are still seeing some disagreement between the models used for guidance, with some suggestions of the mild spell redeveloping after the two or three day interruption around New Years, others saying that cold might actually hang around and deepen gradually, seems to be &quot;on a knife edge&quot; so to speak and waiting for possible major changes in the upper atmosphere to decide that trend. If it stays mild, it seems also likely to get quite windy at times; if it were to remain cold, then probably not as windy. Also there would definitely be more rain with the mild option, and chances for sleet or snow eventually with the cold, but even in the mild and windy scenario there could be brief colder turns after cold fronts pass. <br />
<br />
My local weather remained quiet, mostly cloudy with a high of about -1 C. Not sure how my schedule is going to go from now to New Years' Eve, if I don't manage to post updates, perhaps somebody else will take a turn, and in any case, all the best for New Years.</div>

A lot of speculation about a split in the polar vortex in the coming week and the models don&#8217;t handle a SSW very well.

<b>Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
TODAY ..... With high pressure continuing to remain stubborn to the south, it will be a cloudy and settled end to 2018 as the winds veer from a southwesterly direction on the northern flank of the high. These winds will be fairly moderate but they will freshen at times close to northern and northwestern coasts as a cold front sinks southwards from the north of Scotland. This front will bring patchy outbreaks of rain to the north of the country later in the day and the thick cloud in some areas could produce mist and drizzle especially out west. Maximum temperatures relatively close to average for the end of December with 7-10c, coolest in the south closest to the lighter winds. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ..... Staying dry tonight for the majority but fairly mild as the westerly winds continue whilst at the same time, the cold front tries to sink southwards and clip the eastern side of the country. This front will attempt to dissipate and clear overnight and becomes a band of cloud by early hours of New Year's Day but there could be some drizzle for places in Ulster and northern Leinster. Minimum temperatures getting down to 5-8c for most but could drop to 2 or 3c by morning in Ulster where skies are likely to be clearer behind the front.<br />
<br />
NEW YEAR'S DAY ..... Some further cloud likely to linger around the midlands but otherwise, it will be a brighter day than many have had recently with winds veering northwesterly in direction and variable amounts of sunshine. Maximum temperatures around 5 or 6c in the north whilst 10c in the southwest. The cloud will push into the south and southwest parts of the country later in the day and as a result, it will be frost free in these regions. However, skies will be clear elsewhere and cause quite a widespread air frost. Minimum temperatures could get as low as -2 or -3c in the north and east with very calm winds.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ..... Cloud over Munster and some parts of Connacht will attempt to clear during parts of Wednesday allowing some sunny spells to occur here. Elsewhere, it is likely to be a similar day to New Year's Day with variable amounts of sunshine and a much cooler day than recently with maximum temperatures in the sunny spells in the north and east only ranging between 4-6c whilst further south and west around 7 or 8c. Clear skies resulting in air frost overnight into Thursday in the north and east as minimum temperatures drop below freezing but frost free out west and in the south with more cloud around.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ..... Thursday is likely to be a cloudier day all in all with mostly cloudy conditions returning for most places as the wind veers to a southeasterly direction though there still will be some sunny intervals here and there, mainly in the north. Maximum temperatures remaining fairly cool around 4 to 8c. Frost possible again overnight into Friday up to the north and east.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ..... High pressure continues to persist bringing a mix of cloud and sunny spells over the country and relatively cool temperatures though not exceptionally so with values in the 4 to 8c range. The risk of frost overnight remains in the north and east due to the light winds and any clear skies. <br />
<br />
I hope you all have a happy New Year's Eve!</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks to 200motels and sryanbruen for pitching in with some forecasts, I was away from home base and found rather limited access to the internet, but in any case we returned home and I had a look over the course of the evening while seeing in the new year. Will return to more comprehensive forecasts tomorrow, for now we'll leave it at this ...<br />
<br />
Mild and dry weather will continue for several more days although with a somewhat colder trend in parts of Ulster and Leinster as it will turn several degrees colder in most of Britain with the high pressure closer to the Irish Sea than it was most of last week (in France). So while the west is likely to continue to see temperatures steady in the 8 to 11 C range, the east may find nights a bit colder and daytime readings down a degree or two. That may reverse itself gradually over the last few days of the week and the weekend. After that, it seems to be anybody's guess with two major models having completely different outlooks on what happens to this high after about the 5th or 6th of January. It may hang around for another week and continue the mild, dry spell, or it may get shoved out to the west by advancing colder air building west from central Europe (that according to the European model this morning). The chances of this much colder air reaching Britain appear quite good, for Ireland perhaps more like a 50-50 proposition and in the time frame of the 7th to 10th, but there's nothing very certain about any of these outcomes, and with the guidance wobbling rather like many of us at New Years, confidence is low to say the least. <br />
<br />
The near term seems much more settled and I hope you all have a great year in 2019.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Cloudy with a few sunny breaks mostly in north and east, patchy drizzle from low cloud or fog in parts of south and west, some isolated dense fog may reduce visibility near higher terrain in southwest. Light southeast winds or calm. Highs generally 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Overcast with some clear patches, drizzle or fog in some parts of south and west, lows 2 to 6 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY to the WEEKEND ... Little change, similar weather conditions expected each day and overnight period. The exact details of where it clears out, who sees some drizzle or fog, may change but almost in a random way from one day to the next. There will be a tendency for the east and north to be colder but there again, if it cleared further west then it could cool down briefly there too. Not much wind or rain is likely in this pattern, but a slight chance of 2 to 5 mm rainfalls by the weekend in the north.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... This weather pattern is really stuck with nowhere to go as the circulation has slowed to a crawl over western Europe. Much colder air is moving south into central and eastern Europe. This sets up a difficult forecast situation because the current stagnant air mass could hang in for anywhere from four to ten days (or in my personal nightmare longer), but if it should ever shift west, it would open the door for the colder air to move in from north, northeast or east depending on the details, and then it might turn considerably colder. That could happen by about the 10th or be delayed to 15th or even longer, nobody really knows for sure and so most of the discussion among forecasters concerns what's happening in the stratosphere which could hold the key to what eventually happens at the lower levels. <br />
<br />
Various models show little consistency from day to day and they have been taking turns showing colder or milder outcomes. This is the most difficult type of weather to forecast a week or two ahead, when a slight change could mean a large shift in temperatures for some regions. It is quite possible that colder air will move into some parts of Britain while not making it as far as Ireland, at least in some early stages of this eventual colder spell, so we'll be keeping an eye on it throughout the weather forum. I am trying to peer over the shoulders of as many people as I can to get a sense of the overall thinking in the weather community, but I find that everyone is rather confused by this disconnect between upper and lower levels of the atmosphere, waiting for &quot;the other shoe to drop&quot; when the lower levels respond in some way similar to what happened last (late) February. And as we know, when that shoe drops, it can be a boot load of snow. I would hesitate to try to time this but eventually there seems very likely to be an outbreak of very cold air on the sort of trajectory that might bring heavy snow to eastern counties, and perhaps at times to northern counties. This has been the long-range forecast all along, of course, but it does seem like a reasonable bet although certainly not &quot;carved in stone&quot; since some westward motion of the atmosphere is required. <br />
<br />
My local weather has been quite cold, while away at the coast, about 10-15 cms of snow fell here (it rained hard during that event where we were), and that has formed a partially frozen crust due to temperatures generally in the -6 to -2 C range day and night. Further east, it's very cold across the Great Lakes region, trending to more average but dry cool conditions on the Atlantic seaboard, and there is very little active weather in North America as well at the present time. A fairly vigorous storm hit the eastern Canadian provinces but that's drifting away into the Labrador Sea today.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Cloudy with a few brighter intervals, those more likely in north and east. Patchy drizzle but little if any accumulation, in some parts of south and west. Highs 6 to 10 C, mildest in Kerry, coldest in east Ulster and north Leinster.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Cloudy with a few clear breaks, rather cold, lows 2 to 5 C, some patchy ground frost where skies clear.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Little change, cloudy with a few breaks, highs 7 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Mostly cloudy, a little light rain crossing parts of the north, becoming a little more breezy than it has been, lows 3 to 6 C and highs 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Breezy, partly cloudy, showers ending. Winds westerly to northwesterly 40 to 60 km/hr. Lows near 4 C and highs near 8 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Slightly colder again during the first half of next week, mostly dry, and moderate northerly winds at times. There are growing signs of even colder weather to follow by about the weekend of 13th-14th, so we will try to flesh that out in coming days. Guidance is still rather scattered but there has been a trend in the past day towards a colder outcome. Many in the weather community seem to feel that the models will take time to adjust to the information already known about the stratospheric warming (which spiked recently at values similar to the event leading into the 28 Feb-2 March episode last winter). The delay in recognition may be ending, but then there's the delay of response of the lower atmosphere to that change already logged by the upper levels. There is already a good source of colder air available and a strong northerly flow across the Baltic into Poland and eastern Germany but it may take a reload of that further west to get Britain and then Ireland into the game. The European model is showing a scenario this morning similar to what I mentioned yesterday, cold for southern Britain that only grazes Ireland indirectly at first (a week from now) but that to be followed by much stronger cold air masses around the 13th and 14th. We continue to watch but in the meanwhile, this calm, dry weather is at least very good for getting things done outside after all the rain in November and December. <br />
<br />
My local weather was overcast with light snow and temperatures near -2 C. We are expecting a lot of snow here over the next five days as the Pacific wakes up again but with the jet stream now in a shallow trough near the west coast. This will translate into heavy rain at sea level there, but mountain passes are expected to see 50 cm snowfalls almost on a daily basis (about 10 cm a day where I live, shovel ready).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy with a few brighter intervals in central and northern counties. Rather cold, except in coastal south and west. Highs generally 5 to 9 C, near 10 C for those coastal regions. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Light rain or drizzle in parts of the north and west, overcast but dry elsewhere, lows 4 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Mostly cloudy, slight chance of drizzle or light rain in west but generally dry, highs 7 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Becoming windy with outbreaks of light rain in the north, isolated showers further south, winds west veering to north-northwest about 50 to 80 km/hr. Lows near 6 C and highs near 8 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Rather windy in east, cold, but generally dry, lows 2 to 5 C and highs 5 to 8 C. Winds northerly 40 to 60 km/hr. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY to FRIDAY of next week will see another visit from the high after it gets pushed aside briefly by this cold spell, but it should be on its last legs by then. So a few more days later next week of overcast skies, light to moderate winds and highs near 8 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Turning colder in stages from about Saturday 12th to Tuesday 15th, some strong west to northwest winds at times, temperatures in the 4 to 7 C range but possibly heading lower after 14th. There are somewhat mixed signs of how strong this cold outbreak will be, but the general theme seems to be &quot;slowly but surely&quot; it will be turning much colder. Snow may be in the picture by about the 15th. In the pattern expected to develop, this snow would likely be heaviest in Connacht and Ulster initially, rather than being a Leinster event from Irish Sea streamers, but eventually winds could turn further through north to northeast as we get later into the month. <br />
<br />
My local weather turned quite mild between two frontal systems and the high was about 7 C, melting quite a bit of the 10-15 cm snow cover we had yesterday. Expecting some sleet or wet snow to develop late today and Sunday as another storm moves inland from the coast.<br />
<br />
Note: New moon is timed for 0129h Sunday 6th (tonight).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy, some light rain in west and north but generally dry in south and east, highs 7 to 11 C. Moderate southwest winds will develop in northwest coastal counties.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Overcast, intervals of light rain, moderate southwest to west winds 50 to 70 km/hr, lows 6 to 9 C.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Becoming windy with outbreaks of light rain in the north, isolated showers further south, winds west veering to north-northwest about 50 to 80 km/hr. Lows 6 to 9 C and highs 8 to 11 C. Temperatures will likely fall gradually in northern counties after mid-day.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Rather windy in east, cold, but generally dry, lows 2 to 5 C and highs 5 to 8 C. Winds northerly 40 to 60 km/hr. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Variable cloud, some outbreaks of light rain in north, but dry in south, rather cold. Lows 1 to 4 C and highs 7 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY and FRIDAY will be back to the dull, milder and nearly calm conditions as the high makes its last stand (we hope). Lows around 4 to 6 C and highs 8 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Increasingly unsettled from next weekend on, with colder days at times, with stronger winds developing from west to northwest bringing a risk of wintry showers especially on higher terrain in north. The longer range guidance continues to offer colder patterns with temperatures closer to freezing, but nothing too severe showing up on charts yet, although a few occasions look quite windy and raw. <br />
<br />
My local weather remained rather calm and mild as a weak Pacific low edges closer, bringing mixed sleety precipitation along for our Sunday weather. The high on Saturday was close to 5 C, a bit above normal for here.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy, some light rain at times in north, isolated showers south and central counties, anything heavier will be quite brief and amounts 2 to 5 mm at most. Winds westerly 40 to 70 km/hr veering to northwesterly 50 to 80 km/hr. Highs 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clearing, quite cold, some frost possible in north and east. Lows -1 to +4 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Partly cloudy and cold, winds diminishing but remaining northwest to north 30 to 50 km/hr. Highs 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Variable cloud, isolated showers, still rather cold except in southwest. Lows -1 to +4 C and highs 7 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY and FRIDAY will see a return to dull, mild and less windy weather although this time southwest winds will continue rather strong in parts of the north. Lows 4 to 7 C and highs 9 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Breezy to windy, turning slightly colder next weekend, and possibly colder still by Monday or Tuesday, as winds turn more to the northwest. Some outbreaks of rain with fast-moving fronts. Highs near 10 C at first, then 4 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday started out quite blustery with sleet at times, then cleared up later, highs near 3 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Cloudy with a few sunny breaks developing in north and east, moderate northwest to north winds adding a rather cold feel although temperatures just slightly down from recent days at 7 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Some clear intervals north and east, lows -1 to +3 C with patchy frost inland, but staying rather cloudy in south and west, lows about 2 to 5 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Cloudy with a few sunny breaks, rather cold in north and east, somewhat milder in south and west with isolated showers or patchy drizzle, light winds. Highs 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY and FRIDAY will be mostly cloudy and breezy with little if any precipitation and highs near 10 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Staying around 10 degrees over the weekend with moderate westerly winds and occasional rain in the north, staying dry in parts of the south. Somewhat colder next week with the risk of a much colder spell developing (guidance continues to be all over the place as models are struggling to handle the stratospheric warming episode that happened a few days ago). We are in a bit of a watch and wait holding pattern and the range of possible outcomes is quite large. <br />
<br />
My local weather featured some light snow at mid-day otherwise cloudy but dry and highs near 1 C. We may get a rare sunny day on Tuesday.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Cloudy with a few brighter intervals, isolated showers or patchy drizzle, in light northerly breezes (backing to westerly near west coast later). Rather cold especially in Ulster and Leinster. Highs will range from 6 C near east coast and in most of Ulster, to 10 C in Kerry and some other coastal areas of south and west. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Variable cloud, isolated showers or drizzle, cool. Lows 2 to 6 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Mostly cloudy, moderate southwest winds returning (40-60 km/hr in coastal north and west). Highs 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Overcast, isolated showers, moderate southwest winds, mild. Lows near 7 C and highs near 12 C. <br />
<br />
WEEKEND OUTLOOK ... Rather windy at times, outbreaks of rain (5 mm could fall), and temperatures steady 9 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
NEXT WEEK ... Possibly quite unsettled and windy, with a growing risk of colder weather developing from the north or northeast at some point between Thursday 17th and Monday 21st. Temperatures will hang on near 8 C until this change occurs and could then fall sharply. As guidance is still very uneven on this transition, it's a question of probability of when the transition will begin. It could take longer than ten days but I believe it will happen before we reach the end of the following week. When the colder spell begins, it could last quite a while so be prepared for that possibility. At some point in the next two weeks to a month, a disruptive cold and snow event seems fairly likely. We can't really begin to guess how disruptive until the details show up on charts, every cold spell has its own quirks and singularities. Some are rather dry and produce only marginal amounts of snow (like March 2013 for example). Others rapidly produce large quantities of snow (like December 2010 and last February into early March). I would say the period from 24 January to 10 February is the highest risk period at the pace of change currently. Change is already beginning to show up in North America with eastern regions facing a sharp colder trend. The first signs of colder weather on any guidance show up around Friday 18th so that is probably the earliest that any wintry weather could strike, perhaps we could say the probability starts around 10&#37; there and increases by about 5% a day until it levels off around 70% by 1st of February. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Tuesday was overcast, quite cold and a very light snow turned heavier by late afternoon, so we now have 3 cms on the ground and more gradually accumulating, with freezing drizzle mixing in, and temperatures steady near -2 C. Once this moves through, we are moving back into milder weather as central and eastern regions turn sharply colder. A possible snowstorm for the Washington D.C. region looms for this weekend but this storm will be coming together out of just some dry cloud formations west of Mexico's Baja peninsula at the present time (a front spinning off the Pacific storm hitting further north). The flow is about to buckle allowing much colder air to sink south into the Great Lakes region, then it will be held in place there as storms rotate around from the remnants of Pacific storms until they reach Greenland. What we need to see for Ireland and Britain to turn colder will be for the Greenland region to develop higher pressures at all levels steering these storms back into the Canadian arctic, and allowing higher pressure near the north pole to slide south into the vacuum left by the rise in pressures near Iceland. This will force the persistent high near Ireland and northwest France to push west to avoid being battered by the southward moving arctic jet stream. This scenario keeps appearing on 10-15 day time scales on various models and will become a big deal for the weather when it finally begins to settle into shorter time frames that are more reliable (and then actually happens).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Cloudy at first with some patchy drizzle or light rain, more widespread in central Leinster, then gradually brightening up around mid-day or afternoon, in light north to northwest winds. Highs 8 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Variable cloud with some clear intervals, rather cold, lows 3 to 6 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy to overcast, mild, highs 9 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Breezy and mild, occasional light rain, winds west to northwest 40 to 60 km/hr, lows near 6 C and highs near 11 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Partly cloudy to overcast, isolated showers, mild. Lows near 4 C and highs near 11 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Outbreaks of light rain, winds southwest 50 to 80 km/hr, temperatures steady near 10 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Somewhat colder in strong west to northwest winds, wintry showers on higher terrain in north, otherwise rain showers for most, highs near 7 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Windy and generally a bit colder all through next week with winds mainly in a west to northwest direction, sometimes quite blustery, temperatures in the 4 to 7 C range most of the time, risk of some wintry showers on higher terrain. Beyond the weekend of 19th to 20th, it may turn even colder with winds from the north and sleety precipitation with a risk of accumulating snow at times. Details continue to vary from one model to another but there is certainly a growing trend towards much colder weather in the last ten days of January. How severe and how long it might last remain the big unknowns. <br />
<br />
My local weather featured a steady light snowfall that eventually added up to about 10 cm, with the temperature around -2 C. This looks like continuing overnight then turning to drizzle as temperatures gradually warm up here to 2-4 C. I think we will lose this nice blanket of snow rather gradually over the following five days, meanwhile local hills and mountains have a lot heavier snow cover and will keep most of that for months now. A weak storm will develop over the south central U.S. on Friday and move towards North Carolina, bringing a 5 to 15 cm snow band into the Washington D.C. region this weekend. That snow might graze New York and Boston as the low tracks to their south, but amounts appear very small.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy, patchy drizzle or light rain in parts of Munster, but a few breaks in the overcast later, highs 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Mostly cloudy, mild, lows 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />

<br />
SUNDAY ... Breezy to windy, mild, although slightly colder in east Ulster, winds west to northwest 50 to 80 km/hr. Lows near 5 C and highs in the range of 8 to 11 C, mildest in south. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Partly cloudy to overcast, mild, lows near 4 C and highs near 10 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Windy, showers and turning somewhat colder, winds west to northwest 50 to 80 km/hr, lows near 6 C and highs 8 to 10 C but temperatures 4 to 7 C by afternoon.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Partly cloudy, passing showers in a cold northwest wind, highs near 7 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Rather cold for the rest of the week, slight frosts returning, and risk of sleet by Saturday 19th. The week following that weekend will be perhaps even colder although at the moment the models seem to be indicating that a sharp frontal zone may form at times near Ireland with the much colder air more likely to dominate in Britain and especially northern and eastern parts of Britain. Given the time scale, this outlook could change to something more like Ireland being on the colder side of the frontal boundary more frequently, so I wouldn't stress these details too much, the main theme of most model guidance at the moment is for increasing risks of very cold weather as we move into late January. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Thursday saw an end to the falling snow which has maintained its 10-12 cm depth despite a rather mild high of 2 C, fortunately no drizzle or rain fell despite the low cloud ceiling all day obscuring views of nearby hills. A weak disturbance in Texas is about to grow into a moderate snow-producing storm heading east towards North Carolina by Sunday. Snowfalls of 10-20 cm are likely from about northern Arkansas and southern Missouri east to Virginia and Maryland. This storm will probably miss New York and Boston or, at the very most leave them with a slight dusting of snow Monday. Much colder weather is flooding south behind this developing storm, with more chances for snowfall in the eastern U.S. for the rest of the month, although a somewhat variable regime with the occasional milder day. These storms are heading northeast then north towards Baffin Island rather than crossing the Atlantic, but some of them will spawn low pressure near southern Greenland that could eject lows towards Scotland, it's when that storm track drifts further south that active wintry weather might begin to affect Ireland in a week to ten days' time.</div>

TODAY ... Breezy, mild, outbreaks of light rain in north by afternoon, winds westerly 50 to 70 km/hr. Highs 9 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Breezy to windy at times, mild, drizzle or light rain in a few places, lows 5 to 7 C.<br />

<br />
MONDAY ... Partly cloudy to overcast, mild, lows near 4 C and highs near 10 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Windy, showers and turning somewhat colder late in the day at least in north and west, winds west to northwest 50 to 80 km/hr, lows near 6 C and highs 8 to 10 C but temperatures 4 to 7 C by afternoon in north Connacht and west Ulster.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Rain at times overnight then becoming partly cloudy, with passing showers in a cold northwest wind, lows near 3 C and highs near 7 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Partly cloudy, rather cold, morning frosts. Lows -1 to +2 C, highs 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Increasing cloud, rain or drizzle, possibly mixing with sleet on higher ground in north, lows near 2 C and highs near 7 C.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... There may be a frontal boundary event shaping up for (on or about) Saturday 19th with sleet or snow possible in north and east, more likely rain and drizzle in south and west, before colder air advancing from the east replaces the remnants of the Atlantic flow which will be in a much weakened state by then, rapidly pushed far to the south by the collapsing frontal boundary low. This would imply the return of dry weather for some period of time under higher pressure, frosts at night and rather cold in the daytime. An even colder northerly flow could then develop after a day or two of this intermediate cold, so in general, it looks like a steady decline in temperatures from mid-week through this outlook period to who knows when ... it's possible that a lengthy cold spell will develop, perhaps with brief interruptions because some guidance suggests that the Atlantic will keep trying to fight back, if rather feebly, once the colder air establishes dominance.<br />
<br />
My local weather was cloudy, almost calm, and rather mild, with a bit of mist from the slowly melting snow (which is still about 8-10 cm deep on the ground). The high was about 4 C. Snow has developed as expected in the Mississippi valley and is spreading towards West Virginia overnight, then into Virginia and Maryland on Saturday afternoon. About 10 to 20 cm is expected (or has already fallen in the St. Louis area).</div>

<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Rain at times overnight then becoming partly cloudy, with passing showers in a cold northwest wind, lows near 3 C and highs near 7 C. Some showers will turn wintry over higher terrain, with hail at lower elevations, but there will also be more sunshine than most days this past few weeks.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Partly cloudy, rather cold, morning frosts. Lows -1 to +2 C, highs 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Increasing cloud, rain or drizzle, possibly mixing with sleet on higher ground in north, lows near 2 C and highs near 7 C. A frontal wave may create a band of sleet or wet snow in some parts of Ulster and north Leinster, and this could begin to shift further west although timing is uncertain this far out. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... There is some chance of the frontal bands of mixed precipitation lingering, but eventually a colder and dry air mass will probably push this disturbance away and bring clearing. Best estimate on temperatures would be in the 2 to 6 C range. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY and MONDAY appear likely to remain cold and dry with some risk of isolated wintry showers feeding in to the south and east coasts on easterly breezes. Sharp frosts -5 to -2 C, and cold daytime highs near 4 C. <br />

OUTLOOK remains rather uncertain as to details but most guidance has cold gradually intensifying with the risk of severe cold spells developing, so stay tuned as we await some sort of model consensus -- this will be a long, slow transition from the current mild spell to the expected cold regime, and I expect there might be one or two brief attempts made by the Atlantic to get back into the game, whether that leads to frontal snowfalls or one-day mild interludes remains to be seen. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was foggy for a while, then the sun tried to break through low stratus cloud layers, while snow on the ground took another slight decrease to 5 cms. The high was about 5 C, this is a very mild air mass and with no snow I think we would be closer to about 9 or 10 degrees. A fairly widespread snowfall across the Ohio valley region has spread into Virginia and Maryland, also southern PA, with amounts of 10 to 20 cms expected. This storm will eventually become the disturbance that approaches Ireland from the west on Thursday and Friday, with most guidance now agreeing that it will be weak and running into a colder easterly wind from the Baltic region; so the last actions of this weather system will be to drop mixed precipitation over parts of Ireland and southern Wales, southwest England by Friday and possibly Saturday morning. Then it will drift further south and die out over the Biscay region or in southwest France possibly.<br />
<br />
The European model is showing a very strong snowstorm for the eastern U.S. next Sunday into Monday (20th-21st) if you happen to have travel plans to New York or any other location in the eastern U.S., expect some disruptions if this comes about. Other guidance is not as bullish on the storm but not entirely in opposition either. This would likely move north towards west Greenland or Baffin Island rather than crossing the Atlantic (as of current guidance).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Breezy and still somewhat milder than average with brief passing showers and some brighter intervals too, winds westerly 50 to 70 km/hr at times, highs 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partly to mostly cloudy, moderate westerly winds, lows 4 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Partly cloudy to overcast, rain developing in west by late in the day, moderate southwest winds and highs 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Turning much colder in the early morning hours and staying quite cold all day as winds veer to northerly 40 to 70 km/hr, passing showers of rain or hail at lower elevations, becoming mixed wintry showers on hills. Morning lows near 3 C and afternoon highs only 6 or 7 C at best. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Sunny intervals, cold, with scattered frosts in the morning. Lows -2 to +3 C, highs near 6 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Mostly cloudy, damp and drizzly with some risk of sleet or wet snow in parts of Ulster and north Leinster. Temperatures steady around 7 or 8 C to the west of a frontal boundary, and 3 to 5 C to the east. This frontal boundary could set up a little further west so stay tuned for the details on that. The further west it drifts, the colder temperatures might become to the east. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Continued outbreaks of sleet or wet snow in some eastern and southern counties, gradual clearing later, cold. Temperatures steady in the 3 to 5 C range and falling below freezing by evening. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Sharp frosts likely, then sunny but quite cold, lows -5 to -2 C and highs 3 to 6 C. Light east winds becoming southeast later.<br />
<br />
MONDAY and TUESDAY may see a brief return to milder weather if some guidance is correct, but it may also become very windy at times with squally showers. The best guess for temperatures is around 7 C but other outcomes are possible. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Almost all guidance is converging on a windy and cold end to January with occasional sleet or snow possible, and temperatures well below average at times (close to freezing daytime and around -3 C or lower at night). Some charts on various models look quite stormy and while we can have little confidence in any details this far ahead, the frequency of these stormy charts on almost all guidance makes me think that it's inevitable that something of that sort will occur within the period 23 to 31 January or into early February. <br />
<br />
My local weather was very drab on Sunday, just a low overcast and temperatures steady near 2 C. Our snow cover stopped its slow decline and remains at about 5 to 7 cms. There is about a metre of snow at the 900 m elevation in the mountains above us though. Meanwhile, the snowstorm continued all day Sunday and Washington DC ended up with 25 cms. This low has moved out into the Atlantic and remnants of it will arrive near western Ireland by Friday morning.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

<br />
TODAY ...  Partly cloudy to overcast, rain developing in west by late in the day, moderate southwest winds and highs 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain, blustery southwest winds veering to west then northwest, turning quite cold after midnight, lows near 3 C.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Turning much colder in the early morning hours and staying quite cold all day as winds veer to northerly 40 to 70 km/hr, passing showers of rain or hail at lower elevations, becoming mixed wintry showers on hills. Morning lows near 3 C and afternoon highs only 6 or 7 C at best. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Sunny intervals, cold, with scattered frosts in the morning. Lows -2 to +3 C, highs near 6 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Mostly cloudy, damp and drizzly with some risk of sleet or wet snow in parts of Ulster and north Leinster. Temperatures steady around 7 or 8 C to the west of a frontal boundary, and 4 to 6 C to the east. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Continued outbreaks of sleet or wet snow in some eastern and southern counties, gradual clearing later, cold. Temperatures steady in the 3 to 5 C range and falling below freezing by evening. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Sharp frosts likely, then sunny but quite cold, lows -5 to -2 C and highs 3 to 6 C. Light east winds becoming southeast later.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Some guidance is advertising a return to milder and wet weather for a few days next week, while other guidance suggests any such change will be very brief and followed by colder east winds and mixed wintry showers in the flow off the Irish Sea. As there is such a wide array of outcomes we will just take note of the range and await further developments, but the colder portion of the guidance is not as cold as what we might be seeing later in the month, although cold enough to produce some snow in the mixture of showery precipitation.<br />
<br />
My local weather remained cloudy and rather cold at about 2 C. The eastern regions of North America were dry and cold and will warm up gradually to near average temperatures, with some active weather expected again this coming weekend.<br />
<br />
Sorry that I can't be very definitive about the trends next week but we are being bombarded with a steady stream of constantly changing guidance that keeps going off in new directions, earlier on Monday there was a set of model runs with intense windstorms next week, and that was more or less withdrawn from sight by this morning. It may return, though, so we can't rule out that outcome either. The uncertainty is being created by a set of unusual conditions in the arctic circulation which keeps the computer models in a perpetual state of confusion, since the eventual location of a polar vortex will determine the trends for several weeks to come. Right now, part of that is wobbling around over Greenland and northeast Canada, while another part has drifted into Scandinavia. Sometimes the models get chasing an idea of one portion taking over from the other, which is the underlying reason we are getting such variable guidance. We can be a little more certain that the mild spell is going to end tomorrow though, at least for the time being.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Some sunshine and cold westerly winds at first, showers becoming more widespread and taking a wintry turn over higher parts of the north and west. Winds west to northwest 40 to 70 km/hr, highs 5 to 8 C, temperatures tending to drop in vicinity of heavier showers. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partial clearing with widespread although not universal frost, most likely inland and in lower lying areas, lows -3 to +2 C.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals, less windy but quite cold, highs 4 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Overcast, outbreaks of light rain trending to sleet or wet snow in parts of Ulster, north/east Connacht and Leinster. Highs about 4 or 5 C for most, but could reach 7 to 9 C in west Munster. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Some sleety showers lingering in the morning, more confined to south and east then clearing by afternoon, cold. Morning lows about 2 C and afternoon highs about 6 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... There remains some uncertainty about the trends beyond Saturday, the most likely scenario is for this modified cold air mass to linger with slight fluctuations in temperature as weak weather systems ripple along from northwest to southeast, but there is some chance of a colder trend too with east winds developing. Eventually it seems likely that a colder spell will develop as the Atlantic is only strong enough to send in very weak frontal systems without much if any warmth, so that there are two different processes that could lead to sleet or snow, easterly &quot;sea effect&quot; showers, or frontal mixed precipitation. I have the feeling that more reliable model output will be available next week once the shock effects of the changes at higher levels work their way through the system and the models have the usual less complicated tasks to process the data. What that more reliable scenario will be is anybody's guess at this point, almost all possibilities are on the table given the mix of players on the field. <br />
<br />
My local weather continued overcast and got a bit colder, with the high only reaching -2 C. We are expecting a similar day today and then some light snow on Thursday. The east coast of North America is gearing up for some mixed sleety precipitation that will fall as heavy snow over higher ground inland from the major cities, but could be a mix of types near the coast. Something to mark on the calendar: if skies are clear on the night of 20th-21st (this coming Sunday night into Monday morning) a total eclipse of the moon will be visible in both Europe and most of North America. The midpoint of this lunar eclipse will be 0517 GMT Monday, or just after midnight in the eastern time zone of North America. For Irish readers, this means the opening stages of the eclipse would be after 0400h Monday and at that point the moon will be fairly high in the southwestern sky, even towards the end of the event around 0600h it will be well above the horizon setting in the west. North American viewers will catch this spectacle (where skies are clear) with the Moon high up in the southern sky (or in my western time zone, in the southeast and reasonably high up for viewing).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Sunny and cold with increasing cloud in west, highs 5 to 7 C. Isolated wintry showers are still possible over higher terrain in the north and west. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Increasing cloud for east, overcast in west, sleet or wet snow may develop inland after midnight, but cold rain near coasts. Lows before midnight could reach -2 deg C, and then temperatures will be slowly rising. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Mostly cloudy, outbreaks of sleet or wet snow in some higher areas of north spreading to east and inland south, but with rain closer to sea level, amounts generally rather light (5 mm rain, could see slushy coatings of snow on some hills). Highs near 5 C for most, but as warm as 9 or 10 C in coastal west. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... A few more wintry showers from time to time, with a gradual brightening of skies for most by afternoon, staying rather cold, morning lows -1 to +3 C and afternoon highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, isolated wintry showers, lows near -2 C and highs near 6 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... There is growing confidence (as models converge on similar solutions) that a cold easterly wind will develop next week, with potential for snow although it may turn out to be mixed wintry showers close to sea level as temperatures are not quite as optimal for snow as we saw last year in late February and early March. Although it is mid-winter now, so the solar heating factor is lower, we do need to see upper level temperatures a degree or two lower before getting too concerned with snowfall accumulations, however some higher areas will probably see some buildup if these charts are accurate. There will also be a fair amount of wintry sunshine especially away from the east and south coasts where the wintry showers will be more prevalent in this pattern. Highs of about 2 to 5 C, and frosty lows of -5 to -2 C could be expected. Later next week, high pressure from near Iceland could approach for a few days leading to clear, cold and frosty weather, similar daytime temperatures but possibly even colder at night. Beyond that, some kind of wintry weather scenario could develop in a new phase, and one suggestion from the guidance would be a northerly with embedded snow showers. So that may take us towards the end of the month with no real reason to suspect that this cold spell will end very quickly into February. However, I should say that the overall situation, while clearer than it was a day or two ago, is by no means settled or inevitable the way most of us thought last winter's cold and snow scenario was going to turn out, so there is some room for alternative outcomes to jump up later. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday was once again overcast and cold with a high near 1 C. Snow is going to be falling here by afternoon although we're not expecting more than 5 cms at most. The east coast U.S. storm forecast for the weekend continues to be mixed rain, sleet and snow near the larger cities and snow inland. A reminder, check yesterday's forecast for details on Monday morning's total eclipse of the Moon.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Some further light rain in parts of Ulster and Leinster this morning, with sleet on some higher ground. Gradual clearing to partly cloudy skies later. There will still be a few isolated showers in the drier air mass, already evident around Galway, but these will be hit or miss with slight risk of hail. Rather cold especially in north and east today, highs 5 to 8 C. South and west coast may approach 10 C later. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clearing for some areas will bring on a slight frost, and patchy ground fog. There will continue to be one or two isolated showers and somewhat more organized bands of light rain or sleet in the north. Lows -2 to +3 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Variable cloud, occasional showers, some risk of sleet or hail in these. Cold. Highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Cloudy with afternoon sunny intervals, cold, isolated wintry showers. Lows -3 to +1 C and highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Sharp frosts in morning (some clear skies for eclipse viewing but very cold), lows -5 to -2 C. Increasing cloud during the day with an outbreak of sleety rain turning to wet snow over some higher terrain by the overnight hours. Highs 4 to 7 C. Becoming rather windy with this band of wintry precipitation (southwest 40 to 70 km/hr veering to northwest 50 to 90 km/hr). <br />
<br />
TUESDAY and possibly WEDNESDAY will be cold, windy with wintry showers likely, some small accumulations of snow mainly over higher ground. Lows will be near -1 C and highs near 5 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Most guidance continues to show even colder weather developing from the east, however, the set-up is a little &quot;delicate&quot; on some guidance and the full effect of this cold spell may be somewhat modified in Ireland as compared to Britain, or, it may be less wintry near the west coast if the colder air is able to extend into parts of eastern Ireland. Although there's some potential for snow, it may remain generally rather dry with this cold spell with Britain being more likely to see outbreaks of snow from the North Sea for two reasons, one being stronger east winds, the other being a deeper cold air mass reaching them. However, this is all rather speculative still and could change closer to the time. The best guess for temperatures later next week would be around -5 C at night and +3 C in the daytime. That could be adjusted by several degrees in either direction once we find out exactly how much of this easterly cold spell is going to impact Ireland.<br />
<br />
My local weather on Thursday was overcast with very light snow falling from mid-day on, 2 cm has accumulated, and the high was -2 C. The eastern U.S. got a light snowfall in places ahead of a complex mixture of sleet, rain and snow expected on the weekend. The heaviest snow appears to be heading for Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York state and New England inland from the Atlantic coast. About 20-30 cms could fall in those states. <br />

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Partly to mostly cloudy, a few widely scattered showers, some sleety over higher terrain. Rather cold, but winds should remain moderate at worst, with highs 6 to 9 C, the milder readings likely to be in Munster and south to west Connacht.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... One or two residual showers could turn wintry as it will be rather cold, with some scattered light frosts possible. Lows about -2 to +3 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, some longer intervals of sunshine than we've been used to seeing most of this winter, but also isolated wintry showers. Highs 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... A sharp frost in the morning hours, but with clear intervals that promises a fairly good chance to see the total eclipse of the Moon between 0430 and 0600h (look to the west for the setting moon). Increasing cloud during the day with southwest winds becoming stronger, reaching 50 to 80 km/hr, followed by outbreaks of rain. Lows -4 to +1 C and highs 6 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Windy and turning colder, winds northwest 50 to 80 km/hr, outbreaks of sleet or cold rain possibly turning to snow on higher ground or even down to lower elevations at times, temperatures steady in the 3 to 5 C range. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... This is where the guidance diverges into two rather different camps. One portion suggests that most of the week will remain cool but not dramatically cold, with passing showers in northwest winds, and the risk of stronger winds developing by the weekend of 26th and 27th, eventually becoming quite cold before the month ends. The other camp says that the colder turn on Tuesday will just be the start of a prolonged colder spell with severe cold moving as close as Britain and possibly touching Leinster if not all of Ireland at times next week. That scenario promises snow showers in abundance for England and Scotland, not too sure about Ireland being included even if this camp wins out, but it could enter the forecast. Camp &quot;A&quot; would feature temperatures around 5 to 7 C daytime and 0 to 2 C overnight, while camp &quot;B&quot; would be several degrees colder than that (so no return to the very mild scenario earlier in the month either way). The reality could of course be a compromise of some of menu A and some of menu B. I would tell you my preference or hunch but I don't really have one given the roughly equal likelihood of either camp being right or wrong from all the signs available. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday was overcast with very small amounts of drizzle but no further snow on top of the 3-4 cm fall we had the previous day. That remains on top of the previous now largely frozen 6 to 8 cms from earlier falls, so it looks wintry outside, although the snow depth here could be three or four times this much based on climatology. Up in the mountains around here they have about 40 cms which is also not quite a normal amount, so no big crises of snow as they are seeing in Austria this winter. The winter storm I've been mentioning is currently in Arkansas pumping up some very mild air into the southeast U.S., while much colder air rushes in to replace it across Kansas and Oklahoma tonight. This is producing snow further north around St Louis to Columbus Ohio, and that snow will move into PA, upstate NY and northern New England tomorrow into Sunday. The coastal cities will get a bit of everything (snow, sleet, freezing rain, rain, strong winds) and end up with a much colder blast from the northwest on Monday. This storm is important to the forecast because much depends on whether it ends up east or west of Greenland, and the two camps that I mentioned have two different outcomes on that question. (East takes it near Iceland and drops it into your part of the world by mid-week, west keeps it out of the developing situation over the north Atlantic which could tip the scales towards a colder outcome).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... A few showers with sleet mixing in on higher ground, but a general clearing trend by afternoon, rather chilly north to northeast winds 40 to 60 km/hr, but a bit of sunshine may compensate for that. Highs 5 to 8 C for most, near 10 C around coastal Munster and Connacht.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear intervals, very cold, frost in most areas. Lows -4 to -1 C. (eclipse of the moon visible 0430 to 0600h, look to your southwest to west as the event proceeds). Some fog patches in valleys by dawn. Widespread icy roads on less travelled routes, and a windscreen scrape likely to take a few minutes of your time (or take a container of hot water out with you, and save yourself the bother).<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Hazy sunshine and very cold in the morning, increasing cloud from northwest to southeast mid-day, a few raindrops or sleet on hills by early evening in Ulster and north Connacht, winds calm at first then increasing to southwest 50 to 80 km/hr. Highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Showers turning wintry as colder air returns from the northwest on gusty winds 50 to 80 km/hr. Hail, sleet and some snow in the mix, mingled with sunny breaks. Temperatures steady in the 2 to 5 C range. Feeling very cold in the wind. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Still rather cold but mild enough that any showers will probably be sleet or rain, lows near -2 C inland, +2 C coastal and cities, then highs near 7 C. Moderate west to northwest winds. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Most guidance is still roughly similar to what we discussed yesterday, I won't go through all that again, but there seems to be a consensus that one or two milder days will return before a more prolonged cold spell is even possible, and there it's a case of getting things to line up so that winds turn sufficiently northerly then perhaps easterly to tap the much colder air lurking off in those directions. I would say confidence in a significant cold spell is moderate rather than low or high. It's better (if you want a cold spell) than just faint signs, but it would be ideal if the models picked up a more robust signal and developed it along similar lines, because one wants to bring in cold air from the north, another from the east, and a third one might be more about cold just developing locally from a lack of milder air moving into the leftover transitional air mass. So it's still a wait and see scenario past mid-week. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday failed to produce any snow as the bands broke up just before reaching us, but it looks like being delivered overnight now, with gradual clearing on Sunday. We might see the eclipse through broken cloud layers (on Sunday evening in our time zone) or we might not, this valley often stays cloudier than most other parts of the region. Meanwhile, snow is spreading through Pennsylvania into New York state and parts of New England away from the Atlantic coast, as well as southern Ontario and Quebec. Some places may get as much as 40 cms. Sleet and freezing rain is more prevalent near the coast, with a heavy rain in parts of Virginia to southern New Jersey and Long Island. Airport delays are likely for travellers in the eastern and central U.S. as much colder air hits on Monday, with icing problems. <br />
<br />
(one last reminder -- eclipse visible before sunrise Monday, check it any time after 0430h, looking to southwest in Ireland, or in eastern North America, high to south around 11 p.m. to midnight. Midpoint of totality is 0517 GMT).</div>

Timing is not that reliable so far in advance but the next cycle of brief milder weather should occur around mid-week with the following colder spell later in the week near the end of January. There is always going to be some risk of severe cold developing as the guidance is only approximately reliable in this situation. If that does happen, then some risks of heavier snow would arise, but in this modified cold pattern, the snow is likely to be fleeting and mostly (although not always) confined to hilly areas. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday continued mostly cloudy and rather mild with a high near 3 C. We had marginal viewing conditions in the evening (in our time zone) for the lunar eclipse, but those improved slowly towards the end of the totality phase, so we got a fairly good view although from what I've seen on the internet, a much subdued colour through the higher cloud layers. With that partial clearing it has dropped below -2 C here. They are digging out of the heavy snow in parts of the interior northeastern U.S. but as we speculated, it was mostly mixed liquid to frozen types on the coast in the larger cities. One of the heavier snowfalls was about 50 cms in the Lake Ontario snowbelt areas from Rochester to Watertown NY. Burlington VT also got about 40 cms. Boston MA has had less snow this winter (so far) than just about anywhere that normally gets snow, a mere 5 cms most of which was in this storm. Even New York and Washington DC have had more. Philadelphia has also had very small amounts. Seattle WA however has had zero snowfall for the winter, which is a bit unusual (their average is about 25 cms). The Midwest and Great Lakes regions have had near normal amounts of snow in most cases.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Windy and cold with mixed wintry showers, some accumulations of snow on hills, sleet or hail showers near sea level, mixed with some sunny breaks, in gusty west to northwest winds 50 to 80 km/hr, adding chill factor to highs only 4 to 6 C. Feeling closer to -1 C. Some thunder possible with showers of various types. Heavier showers of all types are likely to be found in north and west but could happen anywhere. Watch for patches of black ice on roads both this morning and again this evening after sunset.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Breezy and cold, icy on some secondary roads, lows -2 to +2 C. Passing sleety showers with a renewed risk of snow accumulations on higher ground in north.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Breezy and rather cold, passing showers more sleet or rain, with some hail, than snow as temperatures warm slightly, lows about -1 C and highs about 7 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Variable cloud, isolated showers, highs near 8 C except 10 to 12 C near west coast. Winds backing to westerly and increasing to 40 to 70 km/hr. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Windy and milder (briefly) with highs about 11 C. This may last to late afternoon then much colder air will return on Friday night or at the latest, early morning Saturday (some difference of opinion on timing). Rain will accompany this front and turn to sleet and wet snow overnight in some higher parts of the north and west.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Rain or sleet, some snow showers on hills, windy and cold, temperatures steady near 5 C or falling slowly, reaching 2 C by late afternoon and below freezing overnight. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... The guidance continues to be fairly similar on most models and shows a continuing pattern of cold unstable air masses persisting about 70&#37; of the time and milder Atlantic flows intruding for the other 30%. While this would not be severe wintry cold, it will tend to bring more snow to west and north than an easterly might have done, and certainly a lot less to east coast locations. Eventually there are some signs of a turn in wind direction towards the northeast by the end of the month. That might bring on even colder weather eventually.<br />
<br />
My local weather was a welcome change to sunshine and highs near 2 C in a rather chilly northwest wind. We now have a frozen snow pack of about 5-10 cms that will require heavy rain or very mild temperatures to thaw, otherwise it looks like snow but feels like ice (and it cannot be moved very easily). Up in the local mountains there is a softer snow pack of about 40 cms. The eastern regions of North America (at least inland from the coast) saw bright cold weather and they have massive snow or ice problems in the wake of the major storm on the weekend, with no thaw and bitter cold near -20 C. Yet the next storm coming along is supposed to bring a mix of rain and snow to some of these areas and another rainfall to the coastal cities (around Thursday). Snow lovers in that part of the world at least have local mountains where they can find lots of snow, but the coastal plain is now bare after some snow fell about a week ago there. <br />
<br />
Anyway, keep your guard up (or your hopes high if you want snow and cold) because the pattern at the moment is one where much colder trends could easily develop, the modified milder intrusions from the Atlantic could turn into battleground snow or sleet scenarios in another week or two with just a slight southward shift in the jet stream.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Partly to mostly cloudy, a few wintry showers but with the trend for these to become more confined to higher ground and the northeast. Moderate west to northwest winds at times, highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partly cloudy, some isolated showers, some of them wintry in east Ulster and north Leinster. Lows -1 to +3 C there, otherwise about 4 to 6 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Partly cloudy to overcast, some outbreaks of light rain developing, milder. Highs 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Breezy, mild, generally a dry day with limited amounts of sunshine, rain by evening from north to south. Lows 4 to 7 C and highs about 11 or 12 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Windy and turning sharply colder around daybreak, temperatures steady near 5 C falling to near 2 C by evening. Mixed wintry showers in a strong and gusty northwest wind 50 to 80 km/hr. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Breezy and cold, wintry showers and some sunshine at times, lows near -3 C and highs near 5 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... A brief milder interval in the south with rain, but quickly turning colder again, temperatures may reach 7 C in the south but will remain in the 3 to 5 C range further north, mixed wintry showers returning as any rain left over turns to sleet in the south.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Windy and very cold during the last few days of January and into early February, with risk of snow, although temperatures still appear just marginal enough to suggest a mixture of showery precipitation types. Highs around 4 C, overnight lows -4 to -2 C. Winds generally from the northwest 50 to 80 km/hr but may back to northeast by end of the month and into early February. So far, we are not seeing signs of the heavy snowfall experienced last winter (28 Feb to 1 March) in Ireland although some parts of Britain could begin to see moderate amounts of snow in the next two weeks. A few very high areas of the north could accumulate some significant amounts.<br />
<br />
My local weather on Tuesday featured 5-8 cms of wet snow falling on the previously frozen cover, with temperatures steady near -1 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Mild air is acting a bit like that person who said they were leaving half an hour ago but they keep remembering something and come back in. But they do have an important trip to take (to Egypt) very soon and you must drive them to the airport. Make sure they have a one-way ticket.<br />
<br />
TODAY and TOMORROW will be mild again, with temperatures staying in the 8 to 12 C range most of the time, and occasional light rain will fall once the warm frontal band now in the east lets up later this morning. Moderate southwest to west winds 40 to 70 km/hr will keep pumping the mild air in from the Atlantic.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY morning will also be rather mild but increasingly windy. It will turn sharply colder during the morning hours in the west, and by mid-day in the east, with temperatures still up around 8 C before dropping rapidly to about 3 or 4 C in strong gales from the northwest. Rain will turn to sleet then mixed wintry showers in northwest winds increasing to 70-110 km/hr by evening. These very strong winds will howl all night into Sunday morning with temperatures steady near 1 or 2 C, and snow accumulating on hills, mixed wintry showers lower down.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY will continue very windy and cold with further falls of sleet or snow, hail showers and sometimes a cold rain or ice pellets. Winds of 70 to 100 km/hr will continue from northwest to north. Temperatures will be steady near 2 C. Significant snowfalls are possible on higher ground in Ulster, north Connacht and peaks further south and east.<br />
<br />
MONDAY will see a slight relaxation of both winds and temperatures but it will turn colder again later in the day after perhaps reaching 5 to 7 degrees briefly. Showers will turn to mostly rain for a time, then switch back to the mixed wintry variety. Winds rather light for the milder interlude then northwest 40 to 70 km/hr. Temperatures will fall to about 2 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY to THURSDAY will continue wintry with occasional sleety showers, some risk of snow on higher terrain especially, and temperatures staying in the colder than average range of 3 to 6 C with slight frosts each night. <br />
<br />
Late THURSDAY into FRIDAY (1 Feb) a storm may approach with sleet and strong east winds, and this could turn to snow by Saturday 2nd of February, according to current guidance, as easterly winds increase due to the deep low pressure tracking southeast into France. While this does not yet look quite like the snowmageddon scenario of last winter, it does look capable of becoming a heavy snow producer in some places and especially on hills in Leinster and east Munster. Although we have been bombarded with false scenarios at this range for about a month, this one has fairly wide support across most guidance. Beyond that it would likely stay cold for at least another week. <br />
<br />
My local weather saw mostly cloudy skies but no further snow, and it struggled up to the freezing point for a high, so our nice new 10 cm snow cover remained largely untouched. Underneath it is sheer ice so this is one good reason not to move it (except on the previously cleared walks, but I digress) ... rain is now falling in parts of the Great Lakes region where snow was heavy on the weekend and it's creating a nasty mess for them. Fresh snow is falling further north around Lake Superior and a very cold air mass is forming up over central Canada waiting to blast down towards Florida and the southeastern states. This reminds me, if by any chance you have holidays booked in either Florida or the western Med regions, check specific weather for the coming week or two, as some unseasonable cold is headed to both of those holiday destinations. The guidance keeps changing so wait until you have to make a decision (or preparation) to check on the latest, it may not be beach weather or anything close to that at times.</div>

		<div>It's true, the models we use in forecasting really blend very well into the joke thread over in AH, which is why I divide my time, helps me get into the groove. <br />
<br />
Here's the update -- I will just say that it's pretty much the same forecast but with some added uncertainty towards the end (again) as the models once again diverge into various alternate outcomes (some are similar to what we discussed yesterday so it's not entirely a reversal) ...<br />
<br />
<b>Friday, 25 January, 2019<br />
<br />
Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Continued mild, occasional spots of drizzle and brighter intervals in a moderate westerly breeze, highs 10 to 13 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Mild with rain developing, southwest winds increasing to 40 to 70 km/hr. Lows 7 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... the morning will also be rather mild but increasingly windy. It will turn sharply colder during the morning hours in the west, and by mid-day in the east, with temperatures still up around 8 C before dropping rapidly to about 3 or 4 C in strong gales from the northwest. Rain will turn to sleet then mixed wintry showers in northwest winds increasing to 70-110 km/hr by evening. These very strong winds will howl all night into Sunday morning with temperatures steady near 1 or 2 C in east, 3 or 4 C west, and snow accumulating on some northern hills, mixed wintry showers lower down.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY will continue very windy and cold with further falls of sleet or snow, hail showers and sometimes a cold rain or ice pellets. Winds of 70 to 100 km/hr will continue from northwest to north. Temperatures will be steady near 2 C in Ulster, 3 to 5 C elsewhere. Significant snowfalls are possible on higher ground in Ulster, north Connacht and peaks further south and east.<br />
<br />
MONDAY will see a slight relaxation of both winds and temperatures but it will turn colder again later in the day after perhaps reaching 5 to 7 degrees briefly. Showers will turn to mostly rain for a time, then switch back to the mixed wintry variety. Winds rather light for the milder interlude then northwest 40 to 70 km/hr. Temperatures will fall to about 2 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY to THURSDAY will continue wintry with occasional sleety showers, some risk of snow on higher terrain especially, and temperatures staying in the colder than average range of 3 to 6 C with slight frosts each night. Some guidance is bringing a mixed bag of sleet, cold rain and wet snow through parts of the south around Thursday morning, while other guidance keeps this off to the south so that it would be more of a showery (but cold) scenario. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY to SUNDAY (1 to 3 Feb) is now something of a tossup between wintry showers and locally signficant snow, temperatures around 2 to 4 C, according to about half the guidance, or a slight warming trend with rain showers but staying rather cold, 4 to 7 C. These would not feel all that different so if we split the difference for now and say overcast, rain with some sleet or wet snow on hills, and near 5 C, that might work out fairly well. <br />
<br />
The general theme in North America is that extreme cold, which has persisted all winter in north-central Canada, is going to start flowing out of its source region in waves, a process that started about a week ago but is intensifying tonight behind the latest storm system moving into Quebec and New England. This one will form a secondary on the east coast that may bring sleet to some of the larger cities before the cold air moves in. Then a storm develops over the Canadian prairies, turns into a blizzard for the northern plains Sunday and the Great Lakes region Monday. This one will be followed by extreme cold near -30 C with wind chill values to -45 C. The models are having some problems dealing with these extremes, which can generate powerful storms over the warm Atlantic waters (and despite this cold air, the Gulf stream is actually warmer than average east of the U.S.). Where those powerful storms then go will determine the details of weather in western Europe about three to four days week later. My own weather has been rather tranquil, as the mild Pacific air is holding this colder air mass off to our east for now. We might get a slight fall in temperature when the outer edge of the arctic air slides over two mountain ranges to our east and gets into our valley by Monday or so. But I don't expect it to go much lower than -7 C here. The high on Thursday was 3 C. <br />
<br />
Bottom line -- Ireland may escape the worst of the potential for wintry weather (or the best depending on your point of view) but that is not guaranteed in this volatile situation. Some of the biggest snowfalls in Irish weather history have been in February, March or even April, so the book is far from closed.</div>

<b>Saturday, 26 January, 2019<br />
<br />
Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mild at first with some outbreaks of rain developing, winds increasing to southwest 50-80 km/hr, then some squally showers, possible hail and thunder, followed by clearing for a time, and winds veering to northwest 60-90 km/hr. Turning much colder, temperatures dropping from 8-10 C to around 3-5 C. Some wintry showers will follow. <b><i>By later today and overnight be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions especially in the north and west, with locally poor driving conditions as a result of heavy wintry precipitation and strong wind gusts. </i></b><br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Very windy and cold with mixed wintry showers, some accumulations of snow on higher terrain. Lows 1-3 C. Winds northwest to north 70-110 km/hr. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Continued very windy and cold, passing squally and wintry showers, some reduced visibility in sleet, hail or snow at times. Winds northerly 80-120 km/hr. Temperatures steady 3 to 5 C but feeling more like -10 C in the full strength of that north wind, also temperatures could drop to freezing or close to it, during heavier squalls. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Winds dying down by morning, still rather cold and unsettled, mixed showers with an increasing risk of snow as it turns colder again. Temperatures rising to about 5-7 C for a few hours then falling back to 1-3 C. Some accumulations of snow on hills. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY and WEDNESDAY will continue rather windy again and very cold, winds northwest 50-80 km/hr, passing wintry showers and some risk of snow almost anywhere during the period. Highs near 4 C and lows near -1 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY to SUNDAY will bring the risk of sleet or wet snow in several rounds of disturbed weather on east to northeast winds. The details remain a bit sketchy and temperatures could be anywhere from 2 to 7 C so that will affect the elevation where snow might be encountered. Winds likely to be moderate to strong at times. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK remains guesswork with models all over the place, some showing quite cold conditions with a brief very cold interval, and others staying in more of the sleety Atlantic cold westerly theme. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday was partly cloudy and mild with a high near 3 C, after a slight snowfall in the early hours. We are expecting a dry Saturday, snow on Sunday, and colder weather next week. Extreme cold has developed over central North America and is going to create a blizzard-like snowstorm for the Great Lakes on Monday with record low temperatures to follow around mid-week (it is already well below normal today).</div>
