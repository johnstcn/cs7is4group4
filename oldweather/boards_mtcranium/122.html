Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Fog and mist gradually lifting except in some coastal areas, then partly to mostly sunny and warm except in far northwest where overcast with light rain at times. Low cloud and fog are also possible near south coast and cooling sea breezes will keep temperatures down near Irish Sea coasts. Highs 16 to 20 C. Winds generally light and variable, some onshore sea breezes will develop. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Misty or foggy with lows 7 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Sunny intervals developing, warm. Highs 17 to 21 C except cooler near some coasts. Winds light and variable.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Partly cloudy, breezy with isolated showers most likely in Connacht, continued rather warm. Lows 8 to 11 C and highs 17 to 20 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Partly cloudy, breezy, showers becoming heavier late in the day, lows 9 to 12 C and highs 16 to 19 C. <br />

<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... There will be more strong winds towards the weekend of 12th-13th, with showers, and temperatures will continue closer to average values. However, there are once again indications of another spell of warmer settled weather returning in the middle portion of the month.<br />
<br />
My local weather was partly cloudy and warm most of the day with some gusty showers rolling in at about 5 p.m., lasting an hour then back to partly cloudy skies. The high was about 22 C.</div>

SATURDAY and SUNDAY (12th-13th) will be partly cloudy with occasional light rain and highs will be 12 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
The latest guidance is more average than warm but I don't find the pattern very reliable past about Friday at this point, so it could turn out warmer again. <br />
<br />
My local weather continued sunny and very warm with highs near 23 C. Mountain snow is melting at a steady rate now and creeks are running higher although nothing too serious locally, other parts of British Columbia have had flooding problems for several weeks.</div>

Showers most frequent in west and north, sunshine developing at times for south and east by afternoon.

<br />
FRIDAY ... Windy with showers, lows near 8 C and highs 12 to 15 C. Clearing from the west by late afternoon. Winds briefly quite strong from the south in the morning with gusts to 90 km/hr in some places, easing during the afternoon.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Clear intervals early morning will allow for patchy ground frost and lows -1 to +3 C. Sunny intervals at first, then increasing cloud, showers or intervals of rain developing by afternoon and evening (10 to 15 mm likely). Highs about 12 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, showers, lows near 5 C and highs about 13 C.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Cloudy, rain at times, lows near 7 C and highs 12 to 14 C.<br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Unsettled with near normal temperatures next week, highs about 14 C on average. This outlook could change closer to the time as signals are not very strong and some blocking tendencies remain in place which could lead to another warm spell at some point before the end of May -- it was about two weeks between the past two warm spells.<br />
<br />
My local weather continues quite fine with mostly sunny skies on Tuesday and a warm high of 22 C. Clear this evening which reminds me to mention that when you get a clear night, you'll be able to see Venus very bright in the west after sunset, but it sets before or around 10:30 p.m., then later on, Jupiter also quite bright (slightly golden hue) rising in the southeast around 10 p.m. becomes prominent by midnight, after which Antares, Saturn and Mars can also be seen rising in the southeast (Antares has a similar red colour to Mars and at this point is not quite as bright, but about equal to Saturn's brightness, however Saturn has a dull coppery hue compared to the reddish Antares and Mars. -- If you find it possible to see them tonight, the waning moon will be rising after midnight as well. Mercury is also visible this month as a morning star, you would need to look southeast in the early morning hours about 0400h to 0500h to see that and it's not overly prominent but in a fairly empty portion of the sky). I am heading out for a look at the sky so I may edit in a sketch of how the main actors appear.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... A few passing showers dying out during the middle portions of the day, some sunshine but rapidly increasing cloud ahead of a band of rain expected by this evening. Winds moderate southwest 40 to 60 km/hr backing to southerly and increasing this evening to 50 to 80 km/hr. Highs near 14 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Windy with rain, heavy at times especially near Atlantic coasts. Winds southerly 60 to 100 km/hr. Lows near 8 C. About 10 to 15 mm rain by the overnight hours when the rain may be persistent.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Windy with showers, lows near 8 C and highs 12 to 15 C. Clearing from the west by late afternoon. Winds briefly quite strong from the south in the morning with gusts to 90 km/hr in some places, easing during the afternoon.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Clear intervals early morning will allow for patchy ground frost and lows -1 to +3 C. Sunny intervals at first, then increasing cloud, showers or intervals of rain developing by afternoon and evening (10 to 15 mm likely). Highs about 12 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, showers, lows near 5 C and highs about 13 C.<br />

MONDAY ... Partly to mostly cloudy, rain at times, lows near 7 C and highs 12 to 14 C.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Partly cloudy, some dry intervals then a bit more rain likely, lows near 6 C and highs 13 to 15 C.<br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... The current guidance looks rather bland with near normal conditions for mid-May, but the maps do have some signs of easterly winds developing which could signal a warmer spell that the models have not quite caught on to yet, perhaps in a week to ten days from now. <br />
<br />
My local weather turned wet for the first time in weeks, and some of the rain was briefly heavy but it cleared slowly this evening (Wednesday) and highs reached about 17 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy with rain becoming heavy at times, with a few embedded thunderstorms possible by mid-day, reaching Leinster by early afternoon. A rapid clearing trend will follow the rainfall for western counties as winds veer from strong southerly this morning (50 to 80 km/hr) to moderate westerly this afternoon (40 to 60 km/hr). About 10 to 20 mm of rain is likely in most places, with highs 12 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear intervals, cold. Scattered ground frosts and lows about -1 to +3 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Becoming mostly cloudy again with showers or intervals of rain, including a possible thunderstorm. Highs 12 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, showers, lows near 5 C and highs near 13 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Sunny intervals, a little warmer, lows near 6 C and highs near 16 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Some rain in the northwest, a few sunny intervals for the southeast, cloudy for most though, and highs near 15 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Sunshine at times mid-week, staying reasonably warm daytime with cold and possibly frosty nights as higher pressure builds up briefly. That spell may break down somewhat towards the weekend but then another warmer interval seems quite likely after a few somewhat unsettled days, as the atmosphere is going back into a blocking mode. <br />
<br />
My local weather featured more rain on Thursday with highs near 15 C. This will clear away for us on Friday leading to a sunny and very warm spell lasting most of the week. This sounds great except that a lot of mountain snow will melt and rush into already flooded valleys so not such a good deal if you have flooding nearby (thankfully, we don't within a few miles at least, but highways are being closed here and there as flooding rivers take out bridges and culverts).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Some sunny intervals this morning, then becoming mostly cloudy again with showers or intervals of rain, including a possible thunderstorm, most likely in Leinster and midlands. Highs 12 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Most of the shower activity will dissipate but there could be a few remnant showers inland west to north, lows 3 to 7 C.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, some sunny breaks but also a few showers, lows near 5 C and highs near 13 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Sunny intervals, a little warmer, lows near 6 C and highs near 16 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Some rain in the northwest, a few sunny intervals for the southeast, cloudy for most though, and highs near 15 C. Quite cool by the overnight hours, frost likely by Wednesday morning in many inland locations. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY and THURSDAY will be mostly sunny days with clear, cool nights. Frost is likely both mornings in some inland locations. Lows about -2 to +3 C and highs 13 to 16 C. Light winds. Since nights are now getting quite short, this frost will likely come and go before many people start their days so you may not have to deal with it, but plants in the garden will. Should be okay in larger towns due to urban heat island effects keeping temperatures around 2 to 4 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK remains a bit uncertain but the trends on some guidance encourage me to speculate that the next phase will be a warmer spell with southeast winds returning. It may only be a slight increase in temperature in the daytime but nights will probably become milder as more cloud and a breeze will prevent as much frost from forming. Some time around next weekend (19th-20th) temperatures could be back into the 18-21 C range. <br />
<br />
My local weather is improving with some clearing late on Friday afternoon allowing temperatures to rise a bit (18 C). A warm spell or even a heat wave for some lower elevations will have mixed results for the ongoing flooding, mostly not a good scenario with mountain snow packs melting rapidly, but no more rainfall for the next week around here. Highs are predicted to reach 28-31 C for several days here. If you're not a regular reader, this refers to my location in western Canada.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Sunny intervals this morning although rather cloudy in north, then becoming partly to mostly cloudy, isolated showers, highs 12 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Some clear intervals in south, overcast central and northern counties, lows 4 to 7 C. Light rain in a few places towards morning but accumulations only 1 or 2 mm.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Scattered light showers ending, then sunny intervals, a little warmer, and highs near 16 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Some rain in the northwest, a few sunny intervals for the southeast, cloudy for most though, and highs near 15 C. Quite cool by the overnight hours, frost likely by Wednesday morning in many inland locations. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY and THURSDAY will be mostly sunny days with clear, cool nights. Frost is likely both mornings in some inland locations. Lows about -2 to +3 C and highs 13 to 16 C. Light winds. Since nights are now getting quite short, this frost will likely come and go before many people start their days so you may not have to deal with it, but plants in the garden will. Should be okay in larger towns due to urban heat island effects keeping temperatures around 2 to 4 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY to SUNDAY will continue mainly dry but there will be more cloud around and isolated showers or brief intervals of light rain, continued rather warm in the daytime hours with highs 16 to 19 C, and nights milder with lows 6 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK is looking a little better each day as computer models seem to be picking up on the blocking potential and turning that into reasonably warm and settled spells with a few minor disruptions from time to time as we go into the second half of May. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was stupendous, unlike anything I did, and the high was about 25 C under clear sunny skies. We are promised about a week of this with even warmer days. Meanwhile, the GFS model has been featuring (for several days now) an early season hurricane crossing central Florida from west to east around 24-25 May, which would be remarkably early in the season. No telling yet if that idea will actually prove to be even a semblance of reality but interesting to watch as we get closer to the reliable time frame.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Cloudy with a few sunny intervals developing, isolated outbreaks of light rain but accumulations mainly small (1 to 3 mm), highs about 16 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Some clear intervals for southeast, overcast elsewhere, lows 4 to 7 C. Rain may develop before morning in parts of Connacht and west Ulster, once again, amounts not too heavy (2 to 5 mm).<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Patchy light rain during the morning, then clearing slowly around mid-day, highs near 16 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Mostly sunny, isolated frost early morning, lows -1 to +4 C, then sunshine and light winds, highs near 15 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Scattered frosts likely, lows -2 to +3 C, then sunny and pleasantly warm with highs 15 to 18 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Variable cloud, slight chance of showers, warm. Highs near 19 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Mostly dry and relatively warm around next weekend and into the following week, any rain would probably be quite isolated and brief in duration. Highs will continue a little above seasonal normals, 18 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday was sunny with a high near 27 C. A few days ago, I was mentioning a good display of planets in the night sky and got a chance to check it out last night. As I mentioned, Venus is prominent in the west right after sunset then it's gone by about 10:30 p.m. ... after which Jupiter leads a parade of four bright objects (the moon is approaching new so it won't be in the sky until just before sunrise). The order of the four is Jupiter, Antares, Saturn and then Mars. All are fairly low in the south around midnight to 2 a.m., and separated about equally so it's quite easy to tell them apart. Antares and Mars are both noticeably red while Saturn looks like a dull coppery point and Jupiter is very bright and golden similar to Venus although not quite as bright. <br />
<br />
You should have a good chance to see these planets (and Antares) mid-week when skies clear.</div>

		<div>___Update on the longer range outlook___<br />
<br />
It is clear that in the past week the models have struggled in reaching a solution for the second half of May. One night they showed us going into a firmly unsettled pattern with high latitude blocking to occur causing the jet stream to go under it on a southerly track through Ireland bringing with it depressions and low pressures. Another night they showed pretty much the opposite with a more settled outlook. It was kind of confusing where we would go because each had an equal chance.<br />
<br />
However, it seems now that we've reached a point where the anticyclonic, settled solution is more likely to happen for the second half of the month and perhaps maybe, just maybe, going into the early days of June or the start of the meteorological Summer. <br />
<br />
The way I see it currently is that the Azores High is going to frequently throw up ridges around Ireland (sometimes conjoining with the Scandinavian High) followed by temporary, weak fronts which will give some very light patchy rain or cloud with cooler temperatures following before another push of high pressure arrives. This means that we are likely to see a lot of dry weather with temperatures in the mid to high teens. But once any sun comes out, temperatures reaching the 20c mark or more is certainly possible and very likely. Cloud cover will depend on how quick the waters warm up and not to mention, the positioning of the high.<br />
<br />
If we achieve a southeasterly flow as shown on the GFS runs yesterday and the other day, temperatures could get into the mid 20s (23-25c) inland around next week. <br />
<br />
In basic summary, expect a lot of dry weather in the next week for the moment at least and maybe continuing afterwards.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy with light rain developing across Connacht, Ulster and west Munster but this will become showery as it moves further east, amounts will fall off from 3 to 6 mm at first to only 1 to 3 mm for the southeast. There may be a few sunny breaks later in the day with rather cool northwest winds setting in. Highs near 13 C in the north and west, to 16 C in the inland southeast. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Gradual clearing, cool with scattered frost inland. Lows -2 to +3 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Mostly sunny, light to moderate northeast breezes, highs 11 to 14 C near Irish Sea coasts and in east Ulster, but 15 to 17 C in much of central and western Ireland. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... After another frosty night outside larger towns and cities, the day will remain dry and mostly sunny in some parts of the north and east but cloud will increase elsewhere with a slight risk of showers in west Munster. Lows -2 to +3 C, highs 13 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Variable cloud, rather warm, isolated showers. Lows near 7 C and highs near 17 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... There are still indications of reasonably warm spells and mainly dry weather with a few unsettled days in the mix and when it does rain temperatures will likely be closer to average values. No reliable indications of anything close to record warmth but just a steady one or two degrees above average in the outlook, although with east winds at times, that may apply more to the west than Leinster. <br />
<br />
My local weather has been more like mid-summer than mid-May for several days now, on Monday it was sunny and quite warm (28 C). Our trees came into full leaf mode over the weekend and it seems strange to think that six weeks ago we had a foot of snow and sub-freezing temperatures in the daytime hours here.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly sunny, rather cool in coastal parts of Leinster with light onshore northeast winds, limiting highs to about 13 C. Further west, highs should reach 15 to 17 C. Patchy mid-level cloud may appear at times in north with longer spells of sunshine in the south. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear with a slight frost likely inland, lows -2 to +3 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Sunny intervals east, mostly cloudy west with a few outbreaks of light rain, but also some brighter intervals there as well. Highs 15 to 17 C except cooler in onshore breezes near south and east coasts. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Variable cloud with afternoon sunshine returning, warmer for most, isolated showers in the morning will be quite light and brief in duration. Morning lows 4 to 7 C and afternoon highs 15 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Increasing cloud, warm except near south coast due to onshore breezes as winds increase to southerly 40 to 60 km/hr. Lows near 7 C and highs near 19 C, possibly 20 in some parts of the midlands. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Rain from early morning into mid-day hours, heavier in western counties where it could turn thundery at times. Rather warm and humid especially in eastern counties. Lows 10 to 13 C and highs 17 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Next week looks pleasantly warm most of the time with at least some sunshine each day and limited amounts of rain once the Sunday frontal system weakens on Monday and pushes off to the northeast. Highs will reach the low 20s at times and could even top 24 C by mid-week. This warm spell looks like it might last a week to ten days and end gradually with a turn to more of a northerly flow as the warm high retreats west into the Atlantic after its stay close to Ireland. That ending scenario is a lot less reliable than the warm spell itself, it should be noted. <br />
<br />
Summer outlook ... Today I am releasing the hounds of summer and they are friendly I think. Some parts of eastern Ireland are likely to enjoy a warmer than average summer as they join with Britain and other parts of western Europe in a very warm pattern that may dominate most of the season. Temperatures in the east may be as much as 1 to 2 degrees above normal and there will be a few spells of warmth bordering on actual heat (high 20s in other words). Western and northern regions of Ireland are less certain to see this outcome but could have some decent spells of summery weather alternating with periods that  are cloudier and wetter. This regional difference would be the result of a persistent southwest flow that brings frontal systems closer to western Ireland but often these will move north more than east, so that rainfall amounts would likely drop off from west to east. The summer season includes June, July and August for climatologists but the general public often think of the season as starting in late June and lasting into September. I think that version of summer might actually fare better since early June is the one time where cooler conditions are more definitely indicated. <br />
<br />
So, we'll see how all that works out over the duration of the summer of 2018 ... meanwhile we already have summer here in southern British Columbia where Tuesday was sunny and hot in many places, 31 C for a high, and unbroken sunshine with just a few clouds showing up by sunset. There was a rash of severe thunderstorms near New York City on Tuesday with a rare tornado in the Hudson valley west of Newburgh. This is perhaps a sign of the kind of summer we are expecting in North America, heat waves frequent in the west and south central regions, thunderstorms quite frequent with near normal temperatures in the east.</div>

<br />
MONDAY ... The front will continue to drop some rain in western counties but the system will weaken and dissipate by afternoon leading to mostly sunny skies and highs near 19 C (somewhat cooler in coastal Leinster). <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Warm spells will persist most of the rest of May in a generally east to southeast wind flow, highs could reach 22-24 C in western counties at times, but will be held down somewhat in the east by cold waters of the Irish Sea, even so, should be near or slightly above normal in the Dublin region too with highs 17 to 20 C. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday turned mostly cloudy by afternoon then a few isolated thunderstorms developed over mountain ranges, one or two lightning strikes and just spits of rain in the valley so far. Highs reached about 25 before the cloud set in.</div>

TODAY ... Cloudy with a few outbreaks of light rain in parts of the west this morning, some brighter intervals developing, and rather warm except near south-facing coasts, highs generally 16 to 19 C but could be held down to about 12 C by sea fog and low cloud near south coast. <br />

TONIGHT ... Clearing but misty at times, lows 7 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Partly cloudy, warm with highs 17 to 21 C, except for south coast where onshore flow will hold temperatures down to around 13 C. Moderate southerly breezes 40 to 60 km/hr. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Rain at times near west coast, mostly cloudy elsewhere although some sunny breaks possible near east coast, continued rather warm, lows 10 to 13 C and highs 17 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Rain ending for western counties, then variable cloudiness and rather warm for most, cooler in Leinster as winds turn more easterly. Highs will range from 20 C inland southwest to 14 C east coast. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... The following week will continue rather warm with isolated showers developing mostly inland south to west, and some limited sunshine, with highs into low 20s at times away from cooler Irish Sea coasts, although 18 C likely to be tops in most of Ulster. Rainfall totals will be low with just isolated measurable amounts from sporadic showers. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Thursday was overcast with occasional rain that left a total of about 15 mm, which we needed for our gardens. The high was about 19 C. The nearby lake has risen over a metre in the past week from all the meltwater pouring into it, a normal occurrence so no flooding from it, but in the region generally speaking there has been considerable damage from flooding and now the Fraser River is at high levels as it reaches the coast near Vancouver, which has led to some evacuations in a few locations. I mentioned that one of the computer models had been showing an early season hurricane near Florida for around 25-26 May, the latest maps continue to show at least a weak hurricane or strong tropical storm near eastern Florida in the period 26-27 May, so perhaps this is actually going to happen. Landfalling May tropical cyclones are rare, in fact any such storms even in mid-ocean are unusual.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

<br />
TODAY ... Hazy sunshine will fade as cloud increases in western counties, but should hold on well into the afternoon in the east. Warm for most with highs 17 to 21 C. Cooler near south coast where sea fog may drift some distance inland at times, highs 12 to 15 C there. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Occasional light rain or drizzle in west, partly to mostly cloudy and mild in east. Lows 10 to 13 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Rain could be heavy at times on west coast (in particular around Newport) and lighter rain will extend some distance inland over Connacht and west Munster, Donegal, but it appears likely to remain dry with perhaps the occasional sunny break further east. Highs 14 to 20 C warmest inland parts of Leinster.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Occasional showers during the morning, could still be heavy at times in the west, but more frequent sunny intervals developing, rather cool near east coast and in most of Ulster, highs 13 to 16 C, somewhat warmer central and western counties, 15 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Generally dry with northeast breezes gradually turning more southeast during the week. Quite warm for western and central counties, cooler with sea breezes in the east, highs will likely climb gradually to reach the low to mid 20s in western counties and from 14 to 18 C in the east. Nights will be generally rather mild as there will be enough cloud around to prevent sharp cooling, lows 8 to 11 C. There will be some risk of isolated showers or even thundershowers at first but a rather prolonged dry spell will develop for many areas. This warm and dry spell may persist to the end of the month when guidance suggests it will turn considerably cooler in north to northwest winds.<br />
<br />
My local weather was mostly cloudy with a few spits of rain but generally a dry day and a high near 19 C. We are expecting partly cloudy weather all weekend (this is a holiday weekend here) with isolated showers and highs near 21 C. Severe storms are widespread around eastern Colorado, western Kansas and parts of Oklahoma and this complex of storms will move slowly northeast towards the Midwestern states.</div>

<i>ALERT for possible heavy rainfall in western counties including most of Connacht and west Munster, into Donegal, from mid-day Sunday to late Monday afternoon, potential for 30-40 mm total. Rainfall over the eastern half of the country is expected to be closer to 10-20 mm.</i><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Some showery rain will ease over Leinster this morning but a more vigorous band of rain will then push north into west Munster and later into Connacht, while the east continues mostly cloudy with occasional light rain but some dry intervals and brief sunny breaks. Highs 15 to 18 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain will become heavier at times in west Munster, Connacht and west Ulster. It may not cover all of central Ireland or much if any of eastern Ireland. Amounts in the west about 15-20 mm by morning. Lows 11 to 14 C.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Rain continuing heavy at times in western half of the country, a further 20 mm possible. More sporadic and showery rain likely further east, 2 to 5 mm in some places. There will be a fairly rapid drying trend late in the day as the front is expected to fall apart due to higher pressure breaking through it east-west and ending its ability to transport moisture. Highs around 17 C. Foggy at times overnight into early Tuesday<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Mist or fog gradually clearing to sunny intervals developing, isolated showers mainly inland southwest. Lows 6 to 10 C and highs about 18 C west, to 14 C east, due to east or northeast sea breezes from cold waters of Irish Sea. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY to FRIDAY will bring mostly dry and at times sunny weather with the temperatures slowly increasing although continuing the same trend of warmest values western counties, coolest near Irish Sea coasts and in parts of Ulster. By the end of the week, highs may be 22 C inland west, 15 to 18 C east. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK calls for little change to this pattern with slight risk of brief showers at times as somewhat more cloud develops, but in general a prolonged dry spell after the expected rainfall in the next two days. The guidance continues to suggest that the eventual breakdown of this spell will come from northerly winds due to the high pressure shifting further west. However, timing is very unreliable in these situations. Also, the spell could just reload with a warming trend after the brief cooler turn. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was partly sunny with extensive cloud by later afternoon and evening, but dry and pleasantly warm at 21 C. <br />
<br />
I will continue to update you on the Florida tropical storm potential and the latest guidance has weakened the feature to minimal tropical storm intensity near the east coast of Florida in a week's time, making a landfall near South Carolina. A second tropical disturbance then forms west of Florida and moves inland near Alabama a few days later.</div>

TUESDAY ... Sunny intervals, warmer, slight chance of a shower inland southwest. Highs near 19 C inland but held down to 14 C by sea breezes on most coasts where low cloud and fog may drift some distance inland at times. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY to SATURDAY will then provide a warmer and mainly dry spell with sunshine each day and highs reaching the low to mid 20s inland and fairly close to Atlantic coasts as winds will be from an easterly direction, veering more southeasterly towards the weekend. This set-up will expose Irish Sea coasts to cooler sea breezes and highs may only reach 14 C right along the shore but the temperature gradient will be fairly sharp so that even a few kilometres inland, 18 to 20 C will be likely. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... After this warm and dry spell, a slow increase in cloud and shower potential will begin from weak frontal disturbances pushing north. Timing this will be difficult until later in the week and it may be delayed for several days. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday was overcast but reasonably warm at 20 C, and the sun began to break through the clouds by late afternoon; now at almost midnight the skies are clear with a good view of Jupiter and the half moon (about two days away from a close conjunction). No changes on the tropical storm outlook except that the latest guidance has weakened the storm to a very marginal looking depression. The hurricane that we were being shown about a week ago appears to have gone to a better place.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals, although rather cloudy near some south-facing coastlines. Warmer with highs about 18 to 21 C for most, 14 to 17 C east coast and south coast. Slight chance of a very isolated and brief shower or thundershower during the afternoon, most likely in west Munster.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear intervals, mild. Lows 6 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Mostly sunny, warm in western and central counties, cooler near east and south coasts. Highs about 19 to 22 C for most, and 15 to 18 C in some cooler coastal districts. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Cloudy with sunny breaks, warm, scattered showers developing mostly in midlands, inland south. These will bring 2 to 5 mm rainfalls to some locations but many will remain dry. Lows 6 to 10 C and highs 16 to 21 C.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Hazy sunshine, isolated showers possible. Lows 8 to 12 C and highs 17 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY and SUNDAY will see an increase in cloud leading to some passing showers or thunderstorms in light to moderate southeast winds. Except where raining, it should be quite warm although sea breezes may cool a few coastal locations. Highs both days could reach 23 or 24 C (central and western counties in particular). <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... This warm spell keeps on going about one day longer each new day of guidance, but it will of course eventually break down some time, possibly beyond the first of June though. As the forecast shows, it won't be perfectly dry and sunny all the time, a few minor disturbances will continue as long as the warmth persists, and the eventual breakdown seems likely to be a rather cool northerly spell of unknown duration. <br />
<br />
My local weather was just about perfect on Monday with sunshine and a few clouds, highs near 23 C. Went to see a local waterfall in a canyon area, and the temperature near the falls dropped as low as 10 C creating a thermal gradient that you could actually feel as you walked along the trail. Meanwhile, the outlook for the first tropical activity by Sunday-Monday east of Florida remains similar and between that system and a second weak disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico, some heavy rainfalls are likely in parts of the southeast, but winds will peak well below 40 mph according to latest indications (a week ago we were being shown a potential cat-2 hurricane).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Sunny with a few cloudy intervals, isolated coastal fog or low cloud possible but most places will be quite warm with highs reaching 21 or 22 C, held down to 15 or 16 C perhaps in coastal east and parts of Ulster. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear intervals, fog patches. Lows 7 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Increasing cloud, outbreaks of showery rain or brief thunderstorms in some parts of the southeast later spreading to midlands and by evening to parts of the west. Despite that, some places will have little or no rain and considerable sunshine. Warm in general, highs 19 to 23 C, but could be closer to 15 C near east coast and in parts of the south coast. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Sunny intervals, a few more isolated showers but less active than Thursday, highs 19 to 23 C with cooler readings near east and south coasts. <br />
<br />
WEEKEND OUTLOOK ... There is some chance of thundery showers both days, otherwise warm and increasingly humid with a mixture of cloud and sunshine, highs 20 to 24 C except 15 to 17 C near east coast. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Guidance on how and when this warm spell breaks down continues to be very changeable and therefore unreliable; it would appear likely to come either late next week or into the weekend of 2-3 June. <br />
<br />
My local weather continues fabulous with unbroken sunshine and highs near 24 C on Tuesday, clear and cool overnight so more good views of Venus, Jupiter and the half moon. I've mentioned it before, but you can easily find Venus if skies are clear, just look a little north of due west after sunset. And Jupiter is just about as easy to spot, it's a very bright object that looks similar to Venus but not quite as bright, rising in the southeast after sunset, and to the south by about midnight. Later this summer, good views of Saturn and Mars will be available too, you need to stay up past 0100h to see them rising now, but that should advance to 11 p.m. later in June.</div>

<br />
TODAY ... Sunny intervals this morning, increasing cloud with showers and possibly a few thunderstorms developing, most frequent in south central then later inland southwestern counties, but possible anywhere. Rainfalls of 3 to 10 mm are likely. Warm except near east coast with highs 17 to 23 C, closer to 15 C on Irish Sea coasts. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Showers ending, fog patches and misty, quite warm, lows 10 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... A mixture of cloud and sunshine, warm, just a few isolated showers redeveloping, not expected to be as widespread as today. Highs 18 to 24 C central and western counties, near 15 C on east coast and parts of south coast. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Sunny with increasing cloud, warm, isolated showers or thunderstorms by evening in at least the southeast. Lows 12 to 15 C and highs 19 to 24 C, except 15 to 17 C east and south coasts. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, occasional showers, warm. Lows 11 to 15 C, highs 19 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY to WEDNESDAY will continue similar with a mixture of cloud and sunshine, warm temperatures and a risk of showers each day but not a lot of rain overall. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday was sunny and hot with very weak thunderstorms trying to form by evening, one succeeded in producing a few brief gusts to 50 km/hr and a few raindrops. The high earlier was 31 C. Records were set in some parts of B.C. and Alberta. <br />
<br />
The Florida weekend tropical storm risk has now increased again and shifted back to the west coast, with guidance now showing potential for a moderately strong tropical storm with peak winds of 80 km/hr. It makes landfall on the Florida panhandle Monday (which is Memorial Day in the U.S.) and meanders around the region while weakening.</div>

TODAY ... Sunny intervals with cloud over some western counties breaking to partly cloudy skies, warm. A slight risk of a shower or isolated and brief thundershower mainly in the inland south. Highs 18 to 22 C, although closer to 15 C near east and south coasts. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partly cloudy, a few showers in south, warm and humid. Lows 11 to 14 C. <br />

<br />
MONDAY and TUESDAY ... Sunny intervals, very warm and humid. Lows 12 to 15 C and highs 20 to 25 C. Just a slight risk of showers.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY-THURSDAY is currently the expected time for this warm spell to end. Now it appears more likely that the cooler air will work its way around a weak disturbance and push in from the southwest. More frequent rain and a falling temperature trend will bring back more normal temperatures in the high teens. <br />
<br />
My local weather continues very warm with isolated showers, the high Thursday was near 28 C. There is not much change in the tropical storm outlook for Florida, and a prolonged period of heavy rainfalls is likely in parts of the southeast U.S.</div>

<br />
TUESDAY ... Sunny intervals, warm, isolated showers developing again. Lows 8 to 13 C and highs 18 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... A greater risk of showers or isolated thunderstorms mid-week, but only a slight cooling trend as any push of cool air will be weak and replaced rather quickly by another influx of warmer air from the east to southeast. This spell does not appear likely to break down entirely for at least another week although the occasional fresher day may qualify as a short break. <br />
<br />
My local weather continued very warm and mostly sunny with a high near 29 C, a heavy storm rolled by to our north at sunset but all we got from that was a few rolls of thunder and a small shower of rain. Subtropical storm Alberto has formed west of Cuba and will likely transition to a regular tropical storm (no cool air in the circulation at that point). It is still expected to be a strong tropical storm and possibly a weak cat-1 hurricane at some point late in the long weekend with a landfall near Mobile Bay by Monday night.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Sunny and very warm, in fact hot might better describe conditions away from the cooler east coast, with highs likely to reach about 24 or 25 C. The east coast will be closer to 18 C thanks to cooling sea breezes, and a temperature gradient from the coast to central Leinster will see highs into the low 20s in places like Kildare and inland Meath. There is a slight chance of a brief shower developing around Carlow or south Kilkenny and drifting west into south Tipperary or north Waterford. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear and hazy with very muggy and warm conditions, a good view of the full moon. Lows 12 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Almost a repeat performance of today, except for a greater risk of showers and thunderstorms developing around Cork and spreading to Limerick, Clare and north Kerry. One of two of those could become locally heavy. Otherwise, all of the same details as Monday with very warm highs of 24 to 26 C away from a somewhat cooler east coast. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Little change with a mixture of sunshine and cloudy intervals, scattered showers mainly in the south and west, lows of about 15 C and highs 22 to 25 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... This warm spell seems to be very entrenched on the guidance I could access (some problems with the latest GFS guidance) and it is difficult to say when the warm spell will actually break down. Perhaps as per the summer forecast, this is just the start of a prolonged warm trend although I would have to imagine it won't just stay like this to September without any breaks.<br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday was sunny and the high generally was 28 to 30 C although we were getting slight cooling from our relatively small local lake. We are expecting our warm spell to break down for a few days starting Monday night. Meanwhile, Alberto is approaching the Florida panhandle to make a Monday landfall between Pensacola and Panama City. It is not the most vigorous tropical system but unusual for May. A more impactful weather event occurred with flash flooding near Baltimore, Maryland from a stalled frontal system that brought repeating thunderstorm cells and 200-300 mm of rain in western suburbs around Ellicott City, MD. The main street of the town had two metres of muddy water rushing through it as a result and plenty of chaos ensued.</div>

<br />
THURSDAY ... Partly cloudy and warm, isolated thunderstorms possible, highs 21 to 25 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Very little change from day to day well into next week but a trend towards somewhat more cloud and slightly more widespread shower activity at times, while already rather humid, it may become very humid at times by the weekend and early next week. Highs will generally stay in the low to mid 20s. <br />
<br />
My local weather has hit the last day of a prolonged warm spell and dry spell, with a cold front not far away now, but Monday's high was once again close to 30 C. We are expecting heavy showers to develop later today and highs much closer to normal (20 C). Meanwhile, the remnants of Alberto moved into Alabama bringing locally heavy rains and gusty winds. That remnant low will drift north into the lower Great Lakes within the next two or three days bringing drought relief to some places along its path.</div>

TUESDAY to FRIDAY ... Sunny with some cloudy intervals and isolated showers possible but generally dry for most, highs will continue to reach the mid 20s in west and central counties, 18 to 23 C east. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... There are signs of a return to a more normal weather pattern by about the 7th or 8th of June with a weak Atlantic influence returning and temperatures falling back closer to average values which would imply highs around 19 or 20 C. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Thursday was overcast, rather cool with highs only about 15 C, and with rain slowly approaching from the southeast, and it began to rain around supper time with about 5-10 mm so far. This is the outer edges of a heavy rainfall (snow at higher elevations) event over the Rockies and most of Alberta, with 40 mm expected in some places. We could use a bit of rain but with snow pack left to melt, a heavy rain would lead to stream flooding problems and likely this will be the case in valleys east of here.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rather cloudy at first, some sunny intervals developing, warm except near some coasts due to sea breezes, outbreaks of thundery rain likely by afternoon in Ulster, parts of Connacht and west Munster. Some locally heavy rainfalls possible there. Highs 21 to 24 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Showers dying out in west and north, becoming foggy or misty, lows 12 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Hazy sunshine developing, only a few isolated showers or thunderstorms, warm with highs 20 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Partly cloudy, showers and thunderstorms once again rather widespread by afternoon, lows 12 to 16 C and highs 20 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY to FRIDAY ... Partly to mostly sunny and warm, showers becoming very infrequent and isolated. Highs 21 to 25 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... It will gradually become somewhat cooler with a fresher south to southwest wind flow and occasional outbreaks of rain although not a very abrupt change from this week's warm, muggy conditions. And there are signs of a renewed warm spell within a week of this slight breakdown, with another high building up near Ireland. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday began with light rain then cleared partially to passing showers and sunny spells, with rather gusty winds from the south at times, but rather cool with highs only around 16 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Hazy sunshine, very warm in western counties, warm but locally cooler due to sea breezes near east and south coasts, highs 20 to 25 C, showers and thunderstorms developing late in the day inland west and northwest. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clearing, hazy and muggy, lows 12 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY to FRIDAY ... Little change in the pattern, with similar weather each day, hazy sunshine, very warm especially in western counties, and isolated showers or thunderstorms in west and north but many places generally dry. Highs each day 20 to 26 C and lows 11 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Slight cooling is likely by next weekend, on the order of 1 to 2 degrees each day, but even so, it will remain rather warm despite a shift in wind directions first to northerly and then to more variable but westerly. This will tend to spread the heat around more into eastern counties than before, but will introduce cooler sea breezes in western counties. Otherwise it will probably not seem like a major change in the weather with highs still into the low 20s. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday was cloudy with some sunny breaks and a few showers by late afternoon, with highs near 20 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rather cloudy in south with a few showers in west Munster, trending to mostly sunny further north, then cloudy again closer to north coast with chance of isolated thunderstorms. By afternoon, some isolated storms possible all over inland west but only small coverage likely, so most places remaining dry and quite warm with highs 22 to 25 C west, 16 to 19 C south and east, 18 to 21 C north. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partial clearing, fog patches, warm, lows 10 to 15 C. <br />

FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, scattered showers and thunderstorms developing in west, some heavy in north Connacht and west Munster. Highs similar to today, near 25 C inland, 18 to 21 C near coasts. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Partly cloudy, warm, some outbreaks of thundery showers in south spreading to west by afternoon. Quite humid, lows 11 to 16 C and highs 20 to 24 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Partly cloudy, isolated showers, warm. Lows 11 to 16 C and highs 20 to 24 C. <br />

MONDAY ... Sunny intervals, isolated showers, fresher although still rather warm at 18 to 22 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Sunny, highs 18 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... A change in the weather pattern is likely to arrive mid-week with westerly winds returning after a long absence, and some frontal bands of rain, with temperatures considerably cooler for a few days, perhaps only 15 to 19 C according to some guidance (although this warm spell is somewhat zombie-like in that it has refused to die on several other occasions). This cooler interval could last almost a week before any slight return to warmer temperatures but the pattern looks like it could go into a late June warm spell or even heat wave rather easily. <br />
<br />
My local weather warmed up considerably on Wednesday thanks to sunshine and southerly winds, highs reaching 27 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Partly cloudy, warm and humid, with the risk of widespread heavy showers and thunderstorms in Connacht, Munster and midlands as well as south central Ulster. Highs 20 to 24 C. Somewhat cooler near east coast and outer south coast due to sea breezes, some chance of sea fog on outer headlands. Peak of the heavy shower activity will likely be 3 to 6 p.m. with the risk of localized 20-40 mm downpours and spot flooding. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Showers and thunderstorms dying out by midnight, then partly cloudy, close and humid with lows 11 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... A similar cycle of events to today, although there may be a slight shift to the south and east in terms of where the heavier showers and thunderstorms develop, but still generally in the zone of south/east Ulster through the midlands to central Munster. Highs also similar, about 20 to 24 C, with local sea breezes bringing slightly cooler temperatures in some coastal margins. The outer portions of the west coast could also see some cooling breezes and sea fog. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Partly cloudy, warm, showers more isolated but still fairly heavy where they do develop, most likely inland south. Lows 11 to 16 C and highs 19 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Partly cloudy, not quite as humid, but still rather warm, as breezes turn more northerly. This will redistribute the sea breezes more to the north and west coasts. Highs near 23 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals, just the slight risk of isolated showers, highs near 23 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Increasing cloud, becoming windy from the southwest (for the first time in many weeks) ahead of a rain-bearing cold front that will arrive by evening or overnight. Highs near 20 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... There is still likely to be a somewhat cooler and more unsettled theme beyond mid-week, with highs closer to normal, then perhaps a slight recovery to warmer temperatures. Longer term guidance now shows a cool northerly in about two weeks but I would not bet the ranch on that scenario as we saw this appearing for the recent time frame about three weeks ago (and the actual cool northerly was over in Finland and Russia). <br />
<br />
My local weather on Thursday was very warm with increasing high cloud, and some showers are lurking with a cold front just a few miles to the west but it has stalled out for the time being. We might also be in line for heavy storms here on Friday and Saturday.</div>

<br />
TODAY ... Sunny intervals this morning, warm, then scattered showers and thunderstorms, similar in coverage to yesterday if perhaps a bit further east and south. One or two of these may become heavy with locally intense thunder and torrential downpours leading to localized flooding. Highs 19 to 24 C. <br />

<br />
FRIDAY 15th to SUNDAY 17th ... Cloudy with a few sunny intervals, some rain at times, highs 17 to 19 C. <br />

FURTHER OUTLOOK ... There are already some signs of another warmer interval developing in the week of 18th to 22nd, but nothing too conclusive yet. At this point I would estimate highs in the low 20s with slight chance of mid 20s. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday became quite warm again (27 C) and breezy at times, after some overnight thunderstorms that left behind about 10 mm of rain. We are expecting some heavier showers on Saturday morning and a cooler trend.</div>
