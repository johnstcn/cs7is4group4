Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rather cloudy at first but becoming partly sunny, hazy and warm, isolated showers or thunderstorms developing in Munster and south Leinster by afternoon, highs 20 to 24 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear intervals, lows 9 to 13 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... A mixture of cloud and sunshine, moderate northerly winds keeping it rather cool near some coasts but warm again inland with highs 19 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Sunny intervals, warm. Lows 8 to 12 C and highs 19 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Increasing cloud, lows 6 to 10 C and highs 17 to 21 C. Rain at times by evening and overnight, 5-15 mm expected. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Showers ending, breezy, somewhat cooler with highs 16 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Rather cloudy and unsettled with temperatures closer to mid-June normal values (highs 16 to 20 C). <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday turned quite wet after some fog and drizzle in the morning, a steady downpour and temperatures no better than 12 or 13 C, so it felt quite cold after weeks of very warm weather here. The cause is a slow-moving low pressure area to our east bringing severe thunderstorms to Alberta and Montana ... it will become cold enough in our region for snow to fall at highway pass elevations around 1200 metres but at my elevation perhaps 8 C with occasional showers and possibly some hail. The next week or two also look quite cool compared to recent warmth, that has moved on into central parts of the continent now. Still, the good side to this will be a reduced fire risk as it had been quite dry until this weekend.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... A mixture of cloud and sunshine, with sunny spells most likely near south coast this morning, perhaps more widespread by afternoon, and with moderate northerly winds keeping it rather cool near some coasts but relatively warm again inland with highs 18 to 21 C. Many places dry but isolated showers most likely in Connacht and west Ulster.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Cloudy with some clear intervals, lows 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Partly cloudy with sunny intervals, highs 18 to 22 C. Some coasts will be a little cooler due to sea breezes.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Increasing cloud, lows 6 to 10 C and highs 17 to 21 C. Rain at times by mid-day west, afternoon or evening and overnight for eastern counties, 5-15 mm expected in most places. Winds gusting to 70 km/hr, the first really windy day in quite some time.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Showers ending, breezy with westerly winds 50 to 80 km/hr in the morning, easing by afternoon, and somewhat cooler with lows near 9 C and highs 16 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Increasing cloud, showers, highs near 17 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Somewhat unsettled although only normal amounts of rainfall expected, along with near normal temperatures of about 17 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday was unseasonably chilly and we could see snow falling on hilltops at 1300 metres above sea level during the afternoon although the rain had ended by then in valleys, but our high for the day was only about 11 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Cloudy in many areas this morning but some early sunshine for coastal Leinster and parts of the south and west too. The cloud may be fairly stubborn as winds remain quite light but eventually longer bright spells will become more widespread. Highs 17 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Some clear intervals, increasing cloud after midnight in west, lows 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Breezy and rather warm with mostly cloudy skies, winds increasing later in the day to south-southwest 50 to 80 km/hr. Rain across the north and west from late morning, not reaching other regions until evening. Highs 17 to 22 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Very windy during the early morning hours and quite gusty until mid-day, then gradually less windy in the afternoon. Rain ending around sunrise after 15-20 mm falls, but skies partly to mostly cloudy, clearing later. Cooler daytime temperatures, lows near 11 C and highs near 17 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Increasing cloud, rather cool, showers or intervals of light rain (5-10 mm), lows near 7 C and highs near 16 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Rather unsettled with near normal temperatures for a few days, but then turning warmer again by Monday 18th, cooler mid-week followed by a longer warm spell towards the end of the month. <br />
<br />
My local weather remained unseasonably cold on Monday, with passing showers that were wintry just a little higher in elevation, fresh falls of snow could be seen on local hills. The high at valley elevations was about 14 C in sunny spells but the temperature fell off several degrees each time a shower passed in gusty westerly winds.</div>

TODAY ... Mostly cloudy, becoming warm and humid in the south and east, occasional rain mostly in west and north, winds slowly increasing to south-southwest 40 to 70 km/hr. Highs 17 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Heavier rain for a few hours across parts of west and north (5 to 15 mm), just showers at times elsewhere (2 to 5 mm likely), becoming very windy north of Galway Bay after midnight with peak gusts westerly 90 to 110 km/hr in exposed coastal locations around 0400h. Rather windy further south but peak gusts especially inland more moderate (50 to 80 km/hr). Lows 12 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Strong winds gradually moderating through the morning with partial clearing, temperatures steady around 16 C. By afternoon, partly sunny and not as windy. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Increasing cloud, showers developing late in the day, lows 6 to 9 C and highs 15 to 18 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Variable cloud, some heavy showers or thunderstorms possible across Munster, lighter showers elsewhere, rather cool compared to past few weeks with highs only 14 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Partly cloudy, isolated showers, highs near 18 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Warmer again next week, Monday around 23 C, falling back a little for Tuesday and Wednesday then quite warm at the end of the week also. The longer term guidance suggests the warmth may moderate to near normal conditions in the latter stages of June. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Tuesday was improved with sunshine fading behind high cloud, and highs near 17 C. We are expecting some showers in the area for several days but amounts could be slight, with continued rather cool temperatures, then warming up next week.</div>

TODAY ... Partly to mostly cloudy, becoming warm and humid in the south and parts of the east with outbreaks of rain later in the day, while remaining rather cool with frequent rain in north (15-25 mm likely), highs 19 to 22 C south, 15 to 17 C north. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain continuing across parts of the north, gradually clearing from west, intermittent showers south and east. Lows 11 to 13 C.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Morning showers or drizzle, partially clearing west to east by mid-day and turning less humid, with highs 16 to 19 C. Fresh northwest breezes 40 to 60 km/hr with the clearing trend.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Cloudy with sunny intervals, lows 9 to 12 C and highs 17 to 20 C.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Mostly sunny, pleasant temperatures, lows 8 to 11 C and highs 18 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
WEEKEND ... Sunny intervals, very warm especially inland as cooling sea breezes will develop on most coasts, highs each day 22 to 26 C.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... The very warm spell will continue for several days then a slow and gradual return to more normal temperatures is likely but not before several days in the mid to possibly high 20s in some parts.<br />
<br />
My local weather was sunny with a few afternoon cloudy intervals and hot with highs near 30 C. This heat will persist most of the week in all parts of western Canada and the northwest U.S., but recently it has been unusually cool in the desert regions to our south as a &quot;cut off low&quot; trapped some cooler air down there, highs only 15 to 20 C in parts of Nevada and even in the low desert regions of Arizona a few degrees below normal (30-35 C instead of low 40s). Hot weather has also spread into parts of the eastern U.S.</div>

<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear, lows 7 to 12 C. <br />

There will be a slight risk of local thunderstorm activity later in the week most likely to occur in parts of the inland northwest. <br />
<br />
(note: in many areas drought conditions are developing and caution is advised with any open fires -- whatever your local watering restrictions, you will find it more effective to water in the late evening and early morning hours to reduce evaporation)<br />
<br />
Around FRIDAY 29th this heat wave will begin to break down with increasing risk of thunderstorms, highs near 26 C. By the following weekend a moderate northerly flow may develop dropping temperatures to the low 20s with a few showers here and there, although possibly not a substantial amount of rain in general. The longer term outlook does hold some chance for more normal conditions including rainfalls, but sometimes these long dry spells are difficult to break down and models can attempt to change the pattern faster than what actually occurs.<br />

WEDNESDAY and THURSDAY ... Hazy sunshine, hot except in a few coastal areas, lows 12 to 18 C and highs 27 to 32 C (readings above 30 most likely in the inland west). Slight risk of local thunderstorms by Thursday (very small areal coverage if they manage to develop at all).<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, slightly cooler but still quite warm at 25 to 29 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... A weak push of cooler air from the north will take place around the end of the month and the weekend of 30th-1st July could see highs closer to 24 C although a few places in the south may still get into the 27 C range. Only a slight chance of isolated showers as the situation is essentially a reload of the warmth, if perhaps a little less record-breaking in the first week of July when some highs may again reach 28 or 29 C inland. Given the historical tendencies, I don't really trust details that involve returns to near-normal temperatures or widespread showers although I hope they prove accurate as this coming week is going to create very dry ground conditions for most of the country conducive to local fires in rural areas. This almost goes without saying but the U.V. index will be exceptionally high for Ireland and you could get a sunburn on unprotected skin quite fast (within 15-20 minutes of exposure) especially at the beach where the water and sand reflect the rays. Hate to be a nag and you've probably heard this a few hundred times already. <br />
<br />
My local weather is relatively temperate now (we had these conditions in May where I live, June has been closer to normal). The day on Saturday started out cloudy and slowly cleared by late afternoon, the high reaching 22 C. <br />
<br />
The coming heat will spread out over most of England, Wales and France as well if you're travelling but not that much more intense than in Ireland this time as the upper level support for anomalous warmth is actually best over Ireland. Since England and France are normally warmer at this time of year, it should even out although with their larger land masses I expect a few slightly higher extreme readings.</div>

TODAY ... Some cloudy intervals this morning, hazy sunshine and very warm later, highs eventually 23 to 29 C. Cooling sea breezes in east and south with highs 18 to 21 C near shore. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Cloudy intervals, warm, lows 13 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Cloud once again may prevail for part of the morning then sunshine is likely to burn through later, very warm or hot inland with highs 25 to 30 C. Once again cooler near east and south coasts (19 to 23 C). Very slight risk of isolated showers in the west.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY and THURSDAY look like they may be the peak of this hot spell with more sunshine and perhaps one or two isolated thunderstorms developing, highs 27 to 32 C for many, but still some cooling by sea breezes near east and south coasts (20 to 24 C). Nights will be oppressively warm, lows 14 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY will see a slight shift in winds more to a northeast breeze which may cool larger portions of Leinster and Ulster, but it will remain very warm generally with sunshine and highs 25 to 30 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Weekend of 30 June and 1 July will become partly cloudy and not quite as warm with the threat of some heavier thunderstorms in the south, and perhaps a significant drop in temperature in parts of the north, while inland south and central regions remain 24 to 28 C, parts of the north could cool down to near 21 C. Following that, slightly warmer again during the week with highs 26 to 29 C. Longer term indications are for a continued warm pattern in July although perhaps not often as extreme as this coming week. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday was sunny and very warm with a high near 27 C. A strong cold front is rapidly approaching and I am expecting to get woken up by wind, rain and perhaps thunder towards morning. But for now it remains clear with a good view of the nearly full moon between Jupiter and Antares (check it out Monday evening there, you'll find the moon closer to Antares (a red star low in the southern sky) and looking quite full although actual full moon is on the night of 27th-28th.) ... Mars is rising after midnight and looks very bright and distinctly red. Saturn is another prominent object to the left of the moon for the next few nights and near it by Thursday night. It rises about an hour before Mars and can be seen by 11:30 p.m., Mars after 12:30 a.m. low in the southeast. Also, look for Venus after sunset any night this summer, above the setting sun's position in the west-northwest, visible until almost 11 p.m. when it sets.</div>

TODAY ... Cloudy for part of the morning except for west Munster which has already cleared, and the cloud may drop a few brief, light showers, then hazy sunshine will prevail later with very warm, muggy conditions, somewhat fresher near east and outer south coasts. Highs 25 to 30 C except for some coastal areas which will top out around 21 C.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Hazy, very warm and muggy, lows 13 to 19 C.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY to FRIDAY will continue hot and somewhat humid at times, with the trend towards some cooling sea breezes making inroads into eastern counties, while the core of heat will tend to spread further west. Highest readings each day may be around 31 C, but east and south will be generally about 25 C and coastal areas may be as cool as 18 to 21 C. Nights will be rather oppressively warm with lows 14 to 20 C but cooler within that range in east and north Ulster than elsewhere. These days will likely be rain free in almost all locations but one or two isolated thundershowers cannot be ruled out.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY will see increasing cloud with some thundery showers developing in the inland south, continued quite warm and humid but with winds turning a little more to the northeast, allowing larger parts of Leinster to feel some effects of sea breezes. Lows 15 to 20 C and highs 24 to 29 C.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY will see somewhat more widespread thunderstorms in the southern half of the country, some areas of light rain may develop further north where it turns somewhat cooler. Highs in the inland south and west about 25 C, east and north around 20 C. Some weekend rainfall totals of 20-30 mm but overall rather hit or miss with 5-10 mm a common outcome.<br />
<br />
MONDAY will bring further showers or thunderstorms but amounts may be rather spotty, as a weak disturbance drifts north, with cloudy intervals and some sunny spells. Highs will be around 23 C.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK calls for this weak disturbance to begin drifting away from Ulster by Tuesday allowing the return of dry weather with temperatures fairly close to normal as the origin of this new air mass will be southwest of Ireland, highs 20 to 23 C. Later in the week it may warm up again somewhat towards the mid to high 20s.<br />
<br />
My local weather started out with a rumbling thunderstorm that did considerable damage to trees in areas just to our north but spared us, however, long-lasting power outages resulted (here again we were spared while some places within 2 kms of us had the outages). This front has now raced east into the central prairies where it is producing some severe storms. Our high on Monday was about 20 C and more showers and quite cool weather are in store for the next few days here.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Hazy sunshine in most areas, hot in the west and central counties, comfortably warm due to sea breeze cooling near east and south coasts. There may be some cloudy intervals in Connacht and Ulster generating some locally heavy showers or thunderstorms in a few locations, watch for updates if these form. Highs will range from 20-24 C in cooler coastal areas, to 28 to 32 C in hot western and central counties where sea breezes will be much more limited due to a generally southeast wind flow. Humidity has risen somewhat which may make this heat even more oppressive. There may also be a few places with smoke haze from wildfires. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clearing and very warm and muggy, lows only 15 to 20 C in many places (and slow to cool down to these levels too). Full moon will dominate the night sky. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY and FRIDAY will continue this general hot theme with similar cooling to more moderate levels in parts of the east and south. If we do get thunderstorms locally today, that might repeat in one or two locations likely to be just inland from the west coast. Temperatures will also continue similar, highs 28 to 31 C but a little cooler near coasts, and Friday early morning lows will be 15 to 20 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY and SUNDAY there will be some chance of isolated thunderstorms forming over the inland south and also along a weak frontal boundary reaching northwest counties at some point, but remaining hot and dry for most of the country, albeit with a stronger easterly breeze driving sea breeze cooling a little further into Leinster. As winds turn more northeast, the south coast will lose some of its sea breeze cooling potential but places like north Mayo and Sligo could see some increase in sea breezes and most of Ulster more certainly will do so. Highs will likely be down slightly to around 27 to 29 C, with 19 to 23 C near east coast. Nights will remain quite warm at 14 to 18 C. <br />
<br />
By MONDAY a weak disturbance may be able to push far enough north to reach Ireland and set off some more widespread thunderstorms although the warm, dry theme will not be entirely subdued, highs will still manage to reach 25 to 27 C away from these storms, and a more variable wind regime will promote equal sea breeze potential all around the country. This will perhaps continue into TUESDAY before the weak low either dissipates or drifts far enough north to join the northern frontal zones that will remain near the Ulster coast setting off intermittent showers near the northwest coasts. Highs on Tuesday are likely to be a little cooler near 24 C. After that, it appears that a rather warm regime will reassert itself but this time the wind flow will be more southwesterly so that the east may see the higher temperatures which will be less extreme than this week, at about 27 C. The west may be more like 20-23 C in this pattern. As I've mentioned before, the model bias after ten days is often to return things to normal rather than find any reason to repeat a current anomalous pattern, so it probably makes sense to expect this warmth to persist for a good part of July, hopefully in less extreme form generally speaking, but it would not be much of a surprise if this heat wave was followed by one or two more later in the summer season. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Tuesday was cool and pleasant after a rather cloudy morning, some sunny breaks developed, showers staying over the nearby mountain ranges, and highs only 19 or 20 C. Severe storms have now moved east into Manitoba and North Dakota.</div>

My local weather on Thursday was cloudy and cool with light rain at times, highs near 19 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Very warm sunshine will continue for many areas, while banks of low cloud or mist may form near some western coasts, possibly moving inland at times, so that variable conditions may develop for some parts of the west. Later this afternoon, as this marine layer moves further inland, a front is likely to develop from Mayo/Sligo south into Galway, Clare and west Limerick, northwest Cork, and bring the slight risk of thundershowers or at least drizzly outbreaks of light rain locally. And the east will be subject to somewhat more active sea breezes than in recent days, even with some possibility of local mist or low cloud forming in northeast winds. That could bring much lower temperatures on shore in some places. Overall, expect highs to remain in the 27 to 31 C range over about two-thirds of the country, with low 20s or even 18-19 C possible near some coasts. The south coast meanwhile may see less sea breeze cooling if the winds turn northeast but timing of that is uncertain, could apply more to the afternoon and evening. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Any showers that form will die out during the evening, and the low cloud regimes near coasts may thin out while spreading over larger areas, so that fog may form almost anywhere while lows remain in the rather uncomfortable range of 14 to 18 C generally. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... The day may start with more cloud around than most previous days, then break to sunshine, with sea breezes becoming weaker again in west, but continuing fairly strong for Leinster. Increasing cloud over the south coast may lead to evening showers or offshore thunderstorms giving a lightning display if not any significant rain on land from them. Highs about 25 C with a few places making 27 C with longer spells of sunshine, but many coastal areas could be in the 17 to 21 C range and there could be some intervals of sea fog or low cloud there. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Little change from Sunday as a mixture of cloud and sunshine continue, highs 25 to 29 C inland, 18 to 22 C near some coasts, and slight risk of showers or thunderstorms. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY and WEDNESDAY will likely be generally dry days with less cloud and weaker sea breezes, in fact the core of the heat may shift more to Leinster and east Munster, with rather variable winds under a slack pressure gradient. Highs both days 25 to 30 C inland and not that much cooler near coasts, morning lows about 14 C. A slight risk of isolated thunderstorms will develop by late Wednesday. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY and FRIDAY show more potential for scattered outbreaks of thundery showers but no guarantee of this becoming anything very widespread, perhaps 10&#37; areal coverage of the land mass of Ireland and possibly a better chance in Northern Ireland than in the Republic. It will stay warm and become increasingly muggy with highs 24 to 30 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK is very uncertain with guidance really falling into two camps, one suggesting potential for continued very warm and generally dry weather, while another set of models show a gradual return to more normal July weather increasingly open to the usual southwesterly flow of frontal systems and brief settled intervals between them. As I think there will be more hot spells this summer well into August, an interruption in mid-July would not be that out of place since mid-June was also rather unsettled (briefly). <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday was partly cloudy with passing light showers and a high near 20 C. We are running about as far below our normal temperatures here for the past week as you have been above your normals. So I guess we have been dealt the &quot;trough&quot; card while you got &quot;ridge&quot; for that period. The eastern half of North America meanwhile has turned very hot with some readings close to 35 C on Friday.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rather cloudy in the west with a few sunny breaks, highs 19 to 24 C (warmer inland). Variable cloud in both south coast and Ulster with slight chance of showers developing in Ulster, moderate chance later afternoon and evening in south Munster, although heaviest bands may remain just offshore. Highs in these cloudier zones about 20 to 23 C. Parts of midlands and Leinster will have more frequent sunny intervals with cloudy breaks, and warmest in midlands (near 26 C) but with sea breeze cooling for parts of Leinster, a gradient of temperatures between the 26 well inland and 18 C near some coasts. Moderate northeast winds at times. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Intermittent light showers in parts of Munster and far north, otherwise variable cloud, lows 12 to 15 C.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Partly cloudy, isolated showers most likely in west Munster as well as Connacht, Ulster. Highs 24 to 28 C but trending to about 18 to 21 C on east coast. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals, very warm, sea breezes less active but present on most coasts in an otherwise light east wind regime, lows 10 to 14 C and highs 26 to 30 C (22 to 25 C closer to coasts). <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Increasing cloud, warm and muggy, possible heavy thunderstorms in some areas, especially near sea breeze boundaries with inland heat. Highs 26 to 30 C inland, 21 to 24 C coastal. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals, further showers or thunderstorms becoming increasingly confined to Ulster and north Leinster, highs 25 to 29 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY and SATURDAY appear likely to remain rather dry with some sunshine each day, and continued very warm, highs 27 to 31 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Confidence is low in any breakdown scenarios presented by models as these keep drifting back away from the reliable time frame but at the moment there are weak signs of a cooler turn mid-July, however, it may either amount to little or not last very long. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was overcast with steady rain after 1100h and quite cool for here, 17 C. Heat waves continue in the eastern half of the continent.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

<br />
TODAY ... Rather cloudy this morning in the south, sunny most other areas except for some cloud in western Mayo and some scattered patches of low cloud near some other coasts. Most of the cloud in all areas should break up gradually so that all areas will become sunny at times, and very warm with highs 25 to 29 C, except for some east coast areas with sea breezes, and parts of coastal Connacht and Ulster, with highs 18 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear, mist or fog patches by dawn, lows 7 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Hazy sunshine in most areas, very warm except for east coast and some other outer coastal areas. Highs 24 to 29 C for most and 18 to 23 C in some coastal areas. Slight risk of an afternoon shower in west Munster.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY to FRIDAY this generally dry, warm spell will continue with a slight increase in afternoon cloudiness and isolated showers or thunderstorms. Highs 24 to 28 C for most, 18 to 23 C near some coasts. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Very warm weather will continue for several more days and any cooling trend may be rather gradual but there continue to be some much cooler looking pattern on maps about two weeks from now. However, that has been the case for about two weeks so while this is bound to verify eventually, confidence remains low. <br />

<br />
FRIDAY to SUNDAY will be mostly sunny and very warm with highs edging back up towards 30 C inland, weak sea breeze cooling in a few areas. <br />
<br />
NEXT WEEK will bring another very hot spell of weather if current guidance is right, with some chance of 32 C or thereabouts as we saw in late June. The eastern coast sea breeze regime may be quite weak this time with highs 25 to 29 C. Nights will become oppressively warm in some areas. Severe heat is expected in parts of southern England and France (potential for 35 C or higher).

SATURDAY and SUNDAY, probably also MONDAY will remain sunny and very warm, with light and variable winds, a few places slightly cooled by sea breezes, otherwise highs 27 to 30 C. <br />
<br />
Current indications are a little less extreme than the guidance was suggesting at this time yesterday, and the heat may back off slightly starting around Tuesday before returning yet again a few days after that. At some point temperatures may be back to the lower 20s then rising back up towards 30 C by end of next week. There are no indications of widespread substantial rain but some places could see heavy showers or thunderstorms at some point later next week perhaps. Even so, a rather serious drought will continue to intensify, especially in parts of the south and east. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday finally cleared up and we had a very pleasant sunny day with a high near 25 C, not too hot yet but warming up on Thursday to near 30 C. Here, however, we have no drought issues after several days of light rain, and the soil moisture is about average if not a bit on the moist side of normal.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

<br />
TODAY ... Hazy sunshine and very warm in most places, highs 24 to 28 C, but rather cloudy and relatively cool in parts of the west, some patchy drizzle most likely in north Connacht, highs 17 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear at first then rather misty with patchy low cloud, lows 12 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Hazy sunshine, very warm in most places, a bit more cloud likely near west and north coasts. Highs for most 25 to 29 C, a few places will stay closer to 20 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY to THURSDAY ... Little change in the weather pattern is foreseen before Thursday, with a fair amount of sunshine, most places staying dry, and just patchy cloud with isolated very light showers each day, usually more likely to occur in west, central or northern counties. Highs each day 25 to 29 C, with some coastal parts of west and north staying closer to 20 C. Nights warm and muggy, lows 12 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Guidance is now split between two ideas, one being a weak return to Atlantic weather systems although still rather warm, and the other being a continued domination by ridges of high pressure but with local disruption from low pressure separating two portions of the ridge to east and west of Ireland. That scenario could lead to some locally significant showers or thunderstorms most likely to occur in the south or central counties. I don't think there will be any complete reversal of the warm, dry weather but perhaps a modification towards more average conditions for a while. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday was hot (32 C) with scattered thunderstorms developing from mid-afternoon to the evening hours, most of the heavier ones managed to bypass my location to the north, close enough to get strong outflow winds at times, and a few spurts of moderate rain, but it looked severe about 10 miles northwest of here. Power still on though.</div>

THURSDAY ... Cloudy with sunny intervals, showers in a few places, highs 21 to 25 C. <br />
<br />
While no real relief for the drought is expected this coming week, the longer term outlook holds some promise of a change in the pattern, with cooler air masses and occasional rain as part of the mixture. By the third week of July temperatures may be only around normal or even slightly below at times. We saw this same trend in mid-June and it lasted about a week before the very dry spell began, so we can't rule out another return to warm, dry weather by late July or August. Let's hope that this break does materialize and that the country gets some badly needed moisture. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was partly to mostly cloudy with passing showers, none very heavy, and temperatures down several degrees from Friday's heat, with the high around 24 C. Expecting Sunday to be sunny and warm with a high of 27 C here.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

<br />
TODAY ... Rather cloudy or misty at first, then some very warm hazy sunshine developing, would not be surprised if the low cloud held quite a while near some coasts though. Highs 20 to 23 C near those cooler coastlines and 24 to 28 C otherwise.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Extensive cloud or mist, warm and muggy, lows 13 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... A mixture of low cloud and hazy sunshine, similar temperatures to today (24 to 28 away from cooler coastal areas). <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Mostly cloudy, a few showers and chance of a thunderstorm, but likely to be drought relief for only a few places, with lows around 15 C and highs 21 to 25 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY to SATURDAY will see this warm and generally dry spell holding on with some chance of a bit of rain spreading into far west and northwest eventually, highs still in the 21 to 25 C range. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK is rather speculative with guidance not that unified about what happens beyond this coming weekend. The American GFS model is currently showing a full breakdown of the high pressure regime and opportunities for Atlantic frontal systems to take a direct path across Ireland with rain that looks to be at least of normal weekly proportions if not a little more. Hoping that's right (sorry if that was going to be your holiday week, but the country generally needs a soaking rain). The European guidance was looking a bit more subdued on this breakdown, allowing part of it into western regions but then rebuilding the warm blocking high just to the east of Ireland which might mean a prolongation of drought in Leinster and east Munster. Any interruption in the warm/dry regime might not last much longer than a week to ten days with more unified signs of warmth rebuilding later in July. <br />
<br />
My local weather was picture perfect (but I don't have a picture) on Sunday with sunshine and highs near 29 C. We are expecting a repeat today then showers on Tuesday here. The more intense heat has faded over eastern North America and a tropical storm (Chris) threatens to turn into a hurricane south of Long Island. I neglected to mention the brief ocean life span of Beryl a few days ago, the remnant low is bringing rain and non-severe winds to parts of the Windward Islands. So after a blank slate in June, July is starting out rather active.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Hazy sunshine and very warm with highs 24 to 28 C in many parts of the country, but more cloud and isolated showers in Ulster and north Connacht at times, highs 17 to 22 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rather cloudy in north with occasional showers, some clear intervals further south, so that lows of 12 to 15 C under cloud may trend towards lows 7 to 11 C in the inland south. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Mostly cloudy, scattered showers moving further south, potential for perhaps 5 mm of rain in some places, but some parts of the south possibly remaining dry. Highs 18 to 22 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY to SUNDAY will maintain generally warm and dry conditions in the south and east, trending to more frequent cloud and occasional showery rainfalls in west and north, highs will range from 25 C or a little higher at times in the south and east, to 20 C or a little lower in parts of the west and north. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK for next week remains somewhat uncertain but most guidance gives at least some chance of rain at times over larger portions of the country, whether it turns out to be a significant relief to drought may vary from one county to another, but the areas getting rain will perhaps include most regions from day to day as the pattern could become quite a bit cooler (or if other guidance is correct, close to normal for mid-July). My research indicates that there would be a high probability of a return to very warm weather in late July and parts of August so that any changes next week may not persist for the rest of the summer. However, just a heads up, I will be taking a fairly long summer break this year and <b><i>sryanbruen</i></b> is going to post forecasts for about a month here starting around 21st of July. Maybe he can get it to rain. <br />
<br />
My local weather was sunny and rather hot on Monday with highs near 30 C. We're expecting a few passing showers or a thunderstorm later today then several days of dry weather. Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Chris threatens to reach hurricane intensity but well off the New England coast in the next two days, and Typhoon Maria is about to pass northern Taiwan and south of Okinawa, Japan, on its way to a landfall in China in about two days' time. Meanwhile, it may be the middle of the southern winter season, but Australia is entirely free from active weather today with mostly clear skies or harmless high cloud, temperatures well above normal values heading for 17-20 C even in the southern cities. I will try to spot some active winter weather down under between now and my holiday but the pattern looks quite benign. New Zealand has some rain approaching them. I saw a report on the news this past weekend about unusual snowfalls around Cape Town, South Africa, maybe you did too.</div>

<br />
Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Partly to mostly cloudy, with a few light showers moving gradually south from Ulster, later on across parts of Leinster, midlands and west Munster. Amounts only 1-3 mm expected, some places remaining dry. Highs 18 to 23 C. Moderate northerly breezes will pick up in some coastal areas to 30-50 km/hr. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Showers ending, some clearing, lows 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Partly cloudy, warm, a few isolated showers mainly in east Munster and south Leinster, not much accumulation expected, highs generally 19 to 24 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY and SATURDAY will be partly cloudy to sunny days, only a slight chance of isolated showers, although some rain could brush the northwest coastal areas late Saturday from a frontal system spawned by remnants of Hurricane Chris. Highs both days 22 to 26 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY will see this front moving through with some western counties perhaps getting 5 to 10 mm of rain, unfortunately it appears that the front will lose what little energy it has during its trek across Ireland and smaller amounts will occur in Leinster. Some sunny breaks will occur before and again after this band of showers, and highs will reach 23 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... The days following the Sunday frontal passage may briefly turn settled and warm again as a new high forms, highs 22 to 27 C, but later in the week somewhat better chances for rain will develop with a cooler trend, highs only 17 to 21 C. The best bet for any significant rainfalls appears to be around Friday 20th. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Tuesday featured heavy rain in the morning and early afternoon, followed by gradual clearing although not quite fully cleared out yet approaching midnight. The high was about 19 C. <br />
<br />
Chris has become a small but fairly intense tropical cyclone, a cat-2 hurricane northwest of Bermuda tonight, heading for a brush with southeast Newfoundland in about three days' time, then eventually off towards Iceland as an extratropical low; in that phase, a cold front will form and move through Ireland around Sunday 15th. Meanwhile, the weather in Moscow for the World Cup final on Sunday appears likely to be unsettled, warm and humid with highs near 25 C and chance of heavy showers or thunderstorms in the area.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Partly cloudy, warm, and dry in most areas. A few isolated showers could develop by afternoon inland from the south coast, only small accumulations likely. Highs 23 to 26 C (17 to 21 C some coastal areas of north, west). <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear intervals, lows 7 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Hazy sunshine, increasing high cloud from west, very warm. Highs 23 to 26 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Mostly cloudy, except for a few sunny breaks in southeast. Warm and humid. Outbreaks of light rain or drizzle in north Connacht and west Ulster spreading to parts of south Connacht, Leinster and west Munster by afternoon. About 2 to 5 mm rain expected.  Morning lows 12 to 15 C and afternoon highs 18 to 22 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Showers, heavier in west during morning with 5 to 10 mm potential, fragmenting to hit or miss light showers 2 to 5 mm further east. This will provide some slight drought relief but not as much as needed (yet). Lows near 12 C and highs near 19 C. Westerly breezes becoming moderate, 40 to 60 km/hr. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Just a few showers in the mix, but cooler temperatures than the past few weeks, for most of next week, highs generally around 18 to 21 C. Some more substantial rainfalls from slow-moving fronts rotating around low pressure to the southwest of Ireland promise better drought relief towards the end of next week (around Friday 20th), fingers crossed on this as the time range is over a week, and model consensus are not that great yet. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday was mostly sunny and warm with a high of about 27 C.</div>

OUTLOOK ... Continued rather cool compared to recent weeks with highs 17 to 21 C, a few showers mid-week, then a few more settled days and turning a bit warmer for a time, with the best indications for heavier rainfall now appearing in the period 24 to 30 July. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Thursday was sunny and hot with a high near 30 C. We are expecting about a week of hot, dry weather ahead with rising fire hazards.</div>

<br />
WEDNESDAY to FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, a few showers here and there, on average perhaps 5 mm of rain in this interval, some sunshine each day also, and highs around 21 C.<br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Variable with temperatures near normal, some chances for more significant rain but will have to wait for more reliable guidance before speculating about how much drought relief could occur, it looks to be a very gradual process that may pick up the pace somewhat in the week following. <br />
<br />
My local weather was sunny and hot with a high near 34 C. Some cloud rolled in from a weak and inactive trough and that's just helping to maintain the high temperatures well into the evening (about 27 C at last check).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Overcast with rain at times, about 5 to 10 mm possible, moderate westerly winds developing, and partial clearing by afternoon in western counties although some scattered showers to continue. Highs 18 to 22 C. Warm and humid in the southeast, fresher most other parts of the country. <br />

WEDNESDAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals, isolated showers, highs near 21 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY-FRIDAY ... Variable cloud, some heavier showers may develop in a few areas, highs near 20 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... A few dry days may follow these light rainfalls, but heavier rain could then follow by middle to end of the following week, or towards 27-28 July. Hopefully the drought will now begin to ease in stages, although it could take several weeks to get through to more normal soil moisture conditions, and another dry spell could develop later in the summer. <br />

Note: if your skies clear this evening, have a look for Mars rising in the southeast after 11 p.m., certainly easy to spot any time after about 11:30 p.m., and will become more prominent as we move into late summer (rising after sunset by August). Meanwhile, you can also see Saturn (low in the south), and Jupiter (very bright, southwest) at the same time as Mars (around 11:30 p.m.). Venus will have set in the west by about 10:45 p.m. The crescent moon for reference will be located between Venus and Jupiter tonight and close to Jupiter in the sky by tomorrow night.</div>
