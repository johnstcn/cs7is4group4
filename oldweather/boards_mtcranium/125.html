Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... It will take most of the morning for the rain to clear the east coast, and the final stages will produce some brief heavy showers or thunderstorms across central counties. Eventually, with winds veering steadily to westerly 40 to 60 km/hr, some clearing will take place and the evening may be the best part of the day with highs by later afternoon reaching 17 or 18 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Cloudy intervals, breezy, lows near 10 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals, breezy, highs 18 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Some sunshine in east and south, a weak frontal band will bring 2 to 5 mm rainfalls to parts of west and north. Lows near 8 C and highs near 20 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Partly cloudy, isolated showers, breezy, lows near 10 C and highs near 17 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals, highs near 21 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Increasing cloud, some light rain at times by late in the day in west and north, highs near 21 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... The weekend will bring some fairly warm and at times sunny weather with the risk of showers greatest in the northwest. Highs will be near 22 C. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was cooler, still very hazy and smoky, and it had the feel of a late October sort of day with almost twilight darkness at times in the afternoon due to the smoke. I spent all day outdoors in a golf tournament which was pleasant more for the outcome than the weather.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rather cloudy at first with a few brief showers more likely in some western counties, then becoming sunny with cloudy intervals by afternoon, breezy (westerly 40 to 60 km/hr), highs 18 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Some clear intervals, revealing the full moon (it was full on Sunday and will still appear that way tonight), lows 7 to 10 C. More frequent cloudy intervals in west and north, a steady breeze will prevent temperatures from falling too far except perhaps in some southern valleys where 4 to 6 C might be recorded.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Some sunshine in east and south, a weak frontal band by afternoon or evening will bring 2 to 5 mm rainfalls to parts of west and north. Lows near 8 C and highs near 18 C west and north 20 C east and south. Some heavier bursts of rain Tuesday night in the south as a wave forms on the front near Cork, 5 to 10 mm could fall by morning.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Partly cloudy, showers mostly confined to morning hours, breezy again from westerly 40 to 60 km/hr, morning lows near 10 C and highs near 17 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals with a chilly start to the day, lows 4 to 7 C and highs warming up to 17 to 20 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Increasing cloud, some light rain at times by late in the day in west and north, highs near 21 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Sunny intervals, breezy, highs 18 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Partly cloudy, isolated showers, highs 14 to 18 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Partly to mostly cloudy, showers, highs 14 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
The first part of September in general looks quite cool with a few spells of near normal and dry weather separated by a few days of mostly cloudy, showery and breezy weather, temperatures in general from now to mid-September will likely average a touch below normal or right on the seasonal average. <br />
<br />
My local weather began a very slow improvement trend which I hope will continue as one November is enough for any given year, and it has felt and looked like that for several days here. Today I joked that we had improved to early October with our cloudy skies, patchy drizzle and highs of 17 C. The visibility improved all the way to 5 kms by afternoon.</div>

<br />

SUNDAY ... Sunny intervals, warm, highs 19 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Hazy sunshine as cloud slowly increases, highs 20 to 24 C. <br />
<br />
The models are starting to pick up on a different theme for a while now, with a temporary return to warm and dry weather, must be the school year starting thing that everyone mentions ... but eventually the pattern does begin to include some cooler and wetter days by the second week of September. <br />
<br />
My local weather improved considerably with some blue skies and highs near 21 C, allowing a better view of where fires are burning to our northwest in forested wilderness areas across a lake from my location, could see three separate fire zones. Nothing too major and little spread has been observed for about a week now.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ...  Partly cloudy, a few isolated showers mostly confined to morning hours, breezy again from west at 40 to 60 km/hr, highs 15 to 17 C.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear intervals, cool. Lows 4 to 7 C, coolest in the inland south. Fog patches widespread by dawn.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Sunny with cloudy intervals, isolated showers possible, with a chilly start to the day, lows 4 to 7 C and highs warming up to 17 to 20 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Increasing cloud, some light rain at times by late in the day in west and north, highs near 21 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Brief and light showers ending during the morning, then sunny intervals, breezy, highs 18 to 21 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Sunny intervals with increasing cloud, warm, highs 19 to 23 C. Some rain possible at times in northwest, as a weak front brushes past the Ulster coast.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Showers in parts of north, breezy, some sunshine at times, highs 18 to 22 C.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Most of next week is looking dry, sunny at times, and reasonably warm in the daytime (near 20 C) with cool nights and probably widespread shallow fog in low-lying rural areas. Nights may be as cool as 3 to 7 C away from warmer coastal areas. This pleasant spell of weather may last or at least be the dominant theme with brief interruptions as models are now backing away from very much active frontal weather, just the occasional slight resetting of this pattern, but it seems likely to break down in mid-September. <br />
<br />
My local weather was quite overcast most of the day with hazy sunshine by afternoon, warming up to 24 C. Smoke layers continue to reduce our visibility at least looking west or north.</div>

<br />
MONDAY ... Gradual clearing, not quite as warm. Lows 8 to 11 C and highs 17 to 20 C. <br />

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

<br />
TODAY ... Cloudy with patchy drizzle this morning then sunny breaks will develop, quite warm, highs 18 to 22 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Mist or fog patches, otherwise clear, lows 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Hazy sunshine, increasing cloud by afternoon, some light rain developing mostly in western counties, spreading further east by evening and overnight. Warm with highs 19 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Showers ending, gradual clearing during the morning, less humid and cooler, highs 15 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
NEXT WEEK in general will be dry, near normal in temperatures, highs 17 to 20 C, and cool overnight, lows 3 to 7 C except in parts of the north where cloud will be more prevalent keeping overnight lows higher and daytime highs a bit lower. <br />
<br />
This rather stagnant high pressure will promote north to northeast breezes at first, turning more east to southeast later, by the following weekend. This may allow temperatures to rise slightly to around 21 or 22 C especially in western counties. <br />
<br />
The blocking will break down in the second week of September with much more of an Atlantic influence and some potential for strong winds developing by about mid-month to 20th. <br />
<br />
My local weather has remained rather bland, still rather hazy from nearby fires that will have to await the autumn rains as little effort is being made to put them out (due to their remote location in a wilderness park area), and highs on Friday reached about 20 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

<br />
TODAY ... Some hazy sunshine especially this morning in some parts of east and south, then outbreaks of light rain more persistent in west, where 2 or 3 mm possible. Rather warm and humid, highs 19 to 23 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Patchy drizzle ending, partial clearing, cooler. Lows 8 to 10 C by dawn. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Partly cloudy, isolated brief showers in north, otherwise mainly dry, cool. Highs 14 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Rather cloudy except near south coast and parts of southeast with some sunny intervals there, patchy drizzle near northwest coasts, lows 5 to 8 C and highs 14 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY to FRIDAY will remain dry in most areas with some isolated light showers in north, and rather chilly, lows 4 to 7 C and highs mostly 15 to 18 C, could reach 20 C in west Munster at times. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK for next weekend is variable cloud and slightly warmer, highs 17 to 20 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK calls for warmer but unsettled conditions following that weekend around 10th-11th, then a clearing trend with near normal temperatures or perhaps slightly warmer than average by mid-month. <br />
<br />
Weak tropical storm Florence is moving west away from the Cabo Verde islands into the eastern Atlantic. It is expected to remain a tropical storm for about a week to ten days, eventually recurving close to the Azores and possibly moving north towards Iceland towards mid-month. Another weak tropical system is expected to follow it. Much stronger super typhoon Jebi is menacing central Japan with a Tuesday landfall expected near Osaka and Kobe. The main uncertainty seems to be how strong it will remain at that point and it looks to be a fast-moving system that will be moving quickly north into far eastern Russia later in the week. <br />
<br />
My local weather was what you see below, highs near 22 C. You might be able to make out some sources of forest fire smoke in this picture which is basically our view looking northwest across a lake to a wilderness park area.<br />

<br />
TUESDAY ... Partly cloudy south and east, overcast with a few breaks, and occasional light rain, north and west. Highs 14 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Partly cloudy, isolated showers, lows 4 to 8 C and highs 14 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Increasing cloud, light rain at times in Ulster by late afternoon or evening. Moderate north winds developing 40 to 60 km/hr. Lows 2 to 6 C and highs only 12 to 16 C, warmest near south coast. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Intervals of light to moderate rain will move into eastern counties at times, winds northerly 40 to 60 km/hr, quite chilly especially in eastern half of the country. Lows 5 to 8 C and highs 11 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Variable cloud, showers but becoming somewhat warmer, highs 15 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY 9th to TUESDAY 11th will likely be rather warm again with southwest winds returning, highs 19 to 23 C. Rain will follow this warm spell and it may become heavy at times later in the week and during the following weekend. <br />
<br />
Tropical Storm Florence continues to move west in the east-central Atlantic Ocean and there is little change in that outlook, meanwhile Tropical Depression 7 is likely to form south and west of the Florida Keys later today and could become a named tropical storm early Tuesday, heading for Mobile, Alabama. Strong typhoon Jebi is approaching south central Japan today and will make a landfall near Osaka and Kobe Tuesday morning Japanese time (tonight in Ireland). It is currently about the same intensity as a cat-3 hurricane but is expected to be in the cat-2 range at landfall.</div>

SATURDAY ... Variable cloud, showers or intervals of light rain, heavier in west Munster and south Connacht, where 10 to 15 mm possible, but becoming somewhat warmer in general, lows 4 to 8 C and highs 15 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY 9th to TUESDAY 11th will likely be rather warm again with southwest winds returning, highs 19 to 23 C. Rain will follow this warm spell for a time and it may become heavy at times by Tuesday or early Wednesday, after which a return to dry and cooler weather is likely. <br />
<br />
Tropical Storm Gordon is likely to become a minimal cat-1 hurricane just before making a landfall near Mobile Bay late today or tonight. Tropical Storm Florence continues to track gradually west into the central Atlantic and so far poses no threat to land. Typhoon Jebi has come ashore as expected near Osaka, Japan; damage reports are sketchy but winds have gusted over 160 km/hr in exposed coastal areas and rainfalls of 100-200 mm an hour have occurred over hilly areas on Shikoku and south central Honshu islands. The eye of the storm was beginning to lose identity in the past hour near Kyoto, northeast of Osaka. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Labour Day Monday here was partly cloudy with gusty northwest winds after some morning showers that didn't last very long, highs near 20 C. I left out Sunday's local weather which was hazy sunshine with a lot of forest fire smoke and 22 C.</div>

FURTHER OUTLOOK ... The rest of next week looks dry and somewhat cooler again with highs 15 to 17 C, chilly nights with isolated frosts. Once this settled spell ends late in the week, the door opens to frequent Atlantic fronts, with stronger winds at times, and the occasional bout of heavier rainfall as fronts pass. Temperatures will be generally at or slightly below mid-September average values, in the 13 to 16 C range.<br />

TODAY ... Mostly cloudy, with bands of light to moderate rain most persistent from Connacht to east Munster and south Leinster, where 5 to 10 mm amounts are likely. Somewhat brighter with dry intervals in parts of Ulster and southwest Munster. Highs only 14 to 16 C for most, perhaps reaching 18 C around Kerry. <br />

OUTLOOK ... Rather unsettled, but some sunshine at times each day, for most of the following week, highs rather cool 14 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
Hurricane Florence has become quite powerful in the central Atlantic Ocean and now has a slight risk of moving close enough to Bermuda in about five days' time to cause some disruptions there. After that model consensus is weak for the eventual meandering track of Florence, so there will be a slight chance that we'll be dealing with its remnants at some point around mid-month, however nothing very definite on that scenario yet. My local weather remained hazy and warm on Wednesday with highs near 24 C, and layers of smoke still making it difficult to see much of the scenery off to our west.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

TODAY ... Some sunny intervals will develop as cloud breaks up later this morning, then some increase in cloud will follow at least in western counties, with rain by late evening there. Highs 15 to 18 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain becoming rather heavy at times, 10 to 15 mm likely, fog and lows near 10 C. <br />

SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, passing showers but some dry intervals with a few sunny breaks. Lows near 9 C and highs near 18 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Warm and humid in the south, rain for most regions but heavier central and inland north, where temperatures may be held down to about 16 to 18 C. Some southern inland locations could reach 20 C or slightly above if there is enough hazy sunshine. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Rain continuing for part of the day in the south and east, gradual clearing from northwest by afternoon, as slightly cooler air presses in. Highs near 19 C south, 16 C north. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Some dry spells mid-week, but showery in parts of the north, then back to more persistent rain by end of next week. <br />
<br />
The longer term outlook is very uncertain due to large unknowns about tropical storm activity. Florence has been reduced to a tropical storm again but is expected to mount a comeback near Bermuda, then go into some sort of long-term meandering track off the east coast of the United States. None of that is really very certain at this point so trying to estimate what could happen ten days from now is difficult. Then there are likely to be two trailing tropical storms in the east central Atlantic, with similar large uncertainties about their future evolutions. Some models are indicating a more settled spell after mid-month for Ireland as high pressure builds up and stalls over western Europe. That would keep all of these tropical systems far away and cause them to continue to eddy around near the Azores. <br />
<br />
My local weather continued warm, very hazy from forest fire smoke, and warm again with highs near 24 C. We're expecting an end to this warm spell on Friday with a cold front bringing rain later. It has been very hot in eastern regions of North America for a week or more.</div>

TODAY ... Rain will be heavy at times this morning and may ease off to drizzle later, with total rainfalls of 10 to 15 mm. Rather foggy over higher terrain. A few brighter intervals by late afternoon or evening, mostly in the west. Highs 15 to 18 C. <br />

<br />
MONDAY ... Increasing cloud after some sunny breaks in the morning, rain spreading in by late afternoon and evening, rather warm and humid especially in Munster and south Leinster. Morning lows 8 to 10 C and afternoon highs 15 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Further outbreaks of rain, total amounts over the two days could be 20 mm in places. The rain is likely to be heavier in central and later southern counties as a front slowly pushes south. Lows near 13 C and highs near 17 C. <br />

WEDNESDAY ... Gradual clearing, showers ending. Highs near 15 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Sunny intervals, isolated showers mainly in north, highs near 16 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Becoming rather unsettled with temperatures somewhat warmer at times, considerable uncertainty on pattern details.<br />
<br />
Florence, still down to tropical storm status, is expected to make a slow approach to Bermuda perhaps missing just to the south, then to the Carolinas by middle of next week. From there, it could meander almost anywhere. Part of the uncertainty is being caused by two other tropical systems. Helene has already reached tropical storm status near Cabo Verde and is likely to make a northward turn in the central Atlantic, beating Florence to the guidance of the jet stream and possibly ending up fairly close to Ireland within a week to ten days (although perhaps in quite a weakened condition). Between Florence and Helene currently is tropical depression number 9, which may become Isaac. That one is supposed to track further south and affect the Caribbean islands at some point. <br />
<br />
My local weather has remained very hazy and smoky, and it was quite warm on Friday with highs about 26 C. Rain along a cold front is just arriving now and should freshen our atmosphere for the weekend once it moves through.</div>

The tropical story remains essentially unchanged. Florence will become a powerful hurricane and may hit parts of the Carolinas by Thursday, with heavy rain further north. Isaac is now also a hurricane and may move across islands around Guadeloupe and Martinique later this week. Helene is further east and looks likely to meander around near the Azores by later this week into next week, so far showing no inclination to move any closer than that to Ireland. <br />

<br />
FRIDAY looks unsettled but rainfall amounts not too heavy, and temperatures near 15 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY could start off fairly dry with sunny intervals in the east, followed by increasing cloud and then rain by later in the day, highs about 16 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY and MONDAY are looking rather wet and windy at this point and some guidance is suggesting remnants of Helene will link up with the frontal system responsible by Monday night or Tuesday to bring a spell of heavier rain and gusty winds, at this point it does not appear too severe and is confined mostly to the southeast. This situation could obviously change closer to the time. Highs during this interval might be a little higher, in a southwesterly flow, near 18 C. <br />
<br />
Little if any change to outlooks for Hurricane Florence and (now only) Tropical Storm Isaac. Florence, a powerful cat-4 hurricane, appears likely to make a slow inland move around North Carolina on Thursday. It could meander around for a time before the jet stream catches hold of it and pulls it into the Atlantic westerly flow. If any remnants of it reach Ireland, that would most likely be towards the end of next week (in about ten days' time) so any details on that will have to wait for a few days. Isaac still appears headed for the Caribbean. Another tropical system is trying to form near western Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula. That one, if successful, would likely stay in the Gulf of Mexico. <br />

<br />
SATURDAY could start off fairly dry with sunny intervals in the east, followed by increasing cloud and then rain by later in the day, highs about 16 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY and MONDAY are looking rather wet and windy at this point and some guidance is suggesting remnants of Helene will link up with the frontal system responsible by Monday night or Tuesday to bring a spell of heavier rain and gusty winds, at this point it does not appear too severe and is confined mostly to the southeast. This situation could obviously change closer to the time. Highs during this interval might be a little higher, in a southwesterly flow, near 18 to 21 C. A non-tropical low following quickly on the heels of the Helene remnants will bring more gusty winds on Tuesday and these could actually be stronger than the weakening tropical remnant, although not damaging (perhaps peaking around 80 km/hr). Beyond that unsettled period, high pressure seems increasingly dominant and it should be well established before any remnants of Florence finish meandering around eastern North America and finally getting pulled east in the jet stream, the current thinking is that this remnant low will approach Greenland and loop around back towards Newfoundland because of this blocking high pressure in the eastern Atlantic. So in other words there could be a pleasant spell of autumn weather towards the 20th and beyond. <br />
<br />
The latest guidane for Florence is rather scattered after a strong hurricane approach to North Carolina by Thursday night, some models want to stall and loop the hurricane near the coast, others want to drag it slowly inland on various paths. Almost all eventually find a window of opportunity for the remnants to get into the core of the jet stream and blast back into the Atlantic in about ten days' time. There remains a slight chance all this could happen much faster and get Florence moving before the blocking really develops, but few models are currently going down that road. <br />

FRIDAY looks unsettled but rainfall amounts not too heavy although a narrow band of heavier rain could form later in the afternoon around south Galway, with highs around 15 C. <br />
<br />

<br />
SUNDAY will bring a gradual clearing trend and quite warm temperatures, lows near 12 C and highs 19 or 20 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY into TUESDAY, a warm and humid southerly flow may last until remnants of Helene arrive. Timing on that event is uncertain with the range being late Monday to late Tuesday. Highs would likely reach 23 C in some inland areas then some heavy rain is likely when the tropical storm remnant arrives. Note: the GFS model currently shows this being a strong wind event Monday night, other guidance is more subdued. I am waiting to see better model consensus on this outcome before making too much out of it. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Florence slowly approaches the North Carolina coast all day and probably most of tonight before edging slowly inland near Wilmington and Cape Fear. Very heavy, prolonged rainfalls may be the biggest problem although damaging wind and surge impacts are almost certain for much of the coast between Cape Fear and Cape Lookout. Florence is expected to make a slow, somewhat disorganized push west then north before being swept into the westerlies, and here again, model consensus is poor, but the GFS model shows this remnant low bringing strong wind gusts to Ireland on Thursday 20th. Some other guidance maintains an earlier theme of blocking high pressure keeping Helene weak and Florence far away. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday was cool and showery with highs near 14 C. Over in Alberta, it is much colder, currently -2 C and snowing at Edmonton.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland </b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy, intervals of light rain with some heavier bursts, about 5 to 10 mm likely. Highs 14 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rather cloudy, but becoming dry as rain moves east, lows 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... A few sunny intervals possible in east and south in the morning, otherwise overcast with rain starting during the mid-day to afternoon hours in the west, becoming quite windy in parts of the north (southwest 50 to 70 km/hr). Highs 16 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Gradual clearing by morning, then some sunny intervals, partly to mostly cloudy later on with isolated showers, warm. Lows about 12 C and highs near 20 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Very warm and humid, strong southerly winds developing late in the day followed by rain overnight. Lows near 14 C and highs near 22 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Windy with showers, turning cooler. Highs near 18 C. ... It currently appears that fairly strong remnants of Helene will cross Ireland from the southwest around late Monday night or Tuesday morning. Peak winds are not expected to be damaging but could reach about 100 km/hr locally. Rainfalls of 10 to 25 mm are likely. A second frontal system will add another round of wet, windy weather Tuesday night.<br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Some improvements mid-week, still relatively mild, then another wet and windy spell late Thursday into Friday, and this could be associated with remnants of Florence. Highs around 18 C. <br />
<br />
Florence is currently hovering just off the coast of central North Carolina and while winds are very strong, the main problem so far appears to be storm surge in the New Bern region. Eventually the continual heavy rainfall will begin to spread floodwaters all over the rather flat region as rivers fail to discharge in part because of the storm surges blocking their outflows. The storm is expected to weaken gradually over the next three days as it drifts northwest and inland as far as eastern Ohio before making a sharp turn east and heading back towards the Atlantic across southern New England around Tuesday. Any remnants of it reaching Ireland are likely to be almost indistinguishable from the normal equinoctial gales that often occur anyway, it's possible that one of those will just swoop in on the jet stream and take away what remains of Florence at that point. <br />
<br />
My local weather was cool and unsettled with thunderstorms at times, and highs barely into the 10-12 C range. Snow was continuing to fall in parts of central Alberta.</div>

<br />
<b><i>Advance alert: The remnant low of Tropical Storm Helene appears likely to move through Ireland on Monday night with potential for strong, gusty winds and heavy rainfalls. See forecasts for details.</i></b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy with outbreaks of light rain starting late morning to mid-day in west, spreading to east by afternoon and evening. About 5 to 10 mm likely. Highs 14 to 18 C. Some gusty southwest winds at times by afternoon in particular around north Connacht and west Ulster, gusts to 70 km/hr. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Showers ending from west to east, mild, breezy. Lows 10 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Variable cloud, some passing showers but also some sunny breaks. Highs 18 to 20 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Hazy and warm, increasing southerly winds, some outbreaks of light rain at first, followed by an interval of heavier rain with possible thunderstorms overnight, in very strong south to southwest winds 80-120 km/hr. Rainfalls may total about 25 mm in places by Tuesday morning. Monday morning lows 12 to 15 C, afternoon highs 18 to 22 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... After strong early morning gusts, the daytime will remain quite windy with rain tapering to showers, some partial clearing in gusty westerly winds 50-80 km/hr by afternoon and increasing again to southwest 70-110 km/hr by evening as another front arrives. Lows 12 to 14 C and highs 17 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Blustery, warm, humid outbreaks of rain at times mid-week into Thursday night becoming heavy for a time, winds peaking at around 100 km/hr. Highs each day near 19 C. After this unsettled period, a somewhat cooler pattern under higher pressure, likely still a degree or two above seasonal normals though, with highs 17 or 18 C, but cooler nights. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday remained quite cool and unsettled with frequent light rain and highs around 14 C. <br />
<br />
Florence has continued to weaken gradually with the circulation slowly moving inland near the NC/SC border. Helene this morning is a tropical storm west-northwest of the Azores heading just to the north of the island chain, moderate westerly winds are expected there due to the distance to the centre. <br />
<br />
The situation for Monday night remains fluid, generally speaking it does not look quite as severe as Ophelia (in those places badly affected by that storm such as Cork) but most guidance is on the border of damaging gust potential at this time. We may have to wait until Monday to have any firm idea how severe this storm may really turn out, but would expect at least a minor disruptive event.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Variable cloud, some passing showers mostly in the north, but also some sunny breaks, more prolonged in south and east. Highs 18 to 20 C. Moderate southwest winds 40 to 60 km/hr.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partly cloudy, very mild, some outbreaks of drizzle or light rain developing in north and west towards morning. Lows 12 to 14 C.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Hazy and warm, highs 18 to 22 C, increasing southerly winds, some outbreaks of light rain at first, followed by an interval of heavier rain with possible thunderstorms by evening into the overnight hours, as very strong south to southwest winds 80-120 km/hr brush parts of the southeast coast. Winds in other regions may be reduced for a time as the remnant eye of Helene pushes through the south and east. Further north and west, winds will back to northeast then northwest as the low passes, with gusts to 70 km/hr. Rainfalls may total about 25 mm in places by Tuesday morning. The forecast situation remains somewhat uncertain and any shift in track could bring larger portions of the country under the effects of stronger southerly to southwesterly wind gusts but these are currently most likely to hit around Waterford, Wexford and on higher portions of Wicklow.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... After strong early morning gusts, the daytime will remain quite windy with rain tapering to showers, some brief and partial clearing in gusty westerly winds 50-80 km/hr by afternoon, then more rain and winds increasing again to southwest 70-110 km/hr by evening as another front arrives. Lows 12 to 14 C and highs 17 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Windy with rain, heavy in the morning hours, tapering off to drizzle later, as winds veer from southwest to west 70-110 km/hr. Lows near 13 C and highs near 17 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Partly cloudy, passing showers in north, lows near 10 C and highs near 18 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Another windy cold front is expected by Friday into early Saturday. This one was earlier expected to contain remnants of Florence but those are now timed to link up with a later disturbance that might not reach Ireland as we are now seeing a return to an earlier model theme of building high pressure near Ireland by next weekend and early the following week. That could provide a pleasant spell of warm days and cool, sometimes foggy nights. Eventually that spell might break down with a northerly incursion of colder air near the end of the month.<br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was overcast with occasional drizzle, but a bit warmer than previous days at 17 C. There was some lightning without much rain about 9 p.m., hopefully that won't lead to any renewed fires (the former ones have pretty much been extinguished now by recent rain, and our air quality has improved, although visibility remains poor a lot of the time due to low cloud and occasional rain).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Warm and humid, some sporadic light rain in west and north, and some hazy sunny breaks in parts of south and east, with highs reaching near 21 C in places. Winds gradually increasing south-southeast 30 to 50 km/hr.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... An interval of stronger south to southwest winds gusting to 80 km/hr possible near Waterford and Wexford coasts, as disorganized remnants of Helene track northeast and merge with another weak low situated further northwest. This will bring bursts of heavier rain through south and east, with relatively lighter amounts elsewhere, maximum amounts near 20 mm. Quite mild overnight with lows 13 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Rather windy all day with passing showers and intervals of heavier rain returning by evening. Highs 17 to 19 C. Winds southwest about 70 to 110 km/hr. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Windy and wet, south to southwest winds 70 to 110 km/hr, lows near 13 and highs near 17 C. About 20 mm of rain in total.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Little change as another frontal wave replaces the departing one, so after a short break a return to strong winds and moderate to heavy rain at times. Lows near 13 C and highs near 16 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Gradually clearing and turning somewhat fresher, with some remnant drizzle or light rain, lows near 10 C and highs near 15 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Heavy showers at times, quite windy, highs near 17 C, turning colder late in the day. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Sunny intervals, breezy, cool. Highs near 15 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... About a week of more settled weather is now expected with higher pressure building up and gradually settling over Ireland. At first it may be rather cool with risk of scattered frosts at night. Later in the dry spell it will turn warmer with cloud streaming in from the southwest to affect west and north at times. Highs next week (24-28 September) may gradually rise from mid-teens to low twenties as a result. <br />
<br />
My local weather was overcast with frequent light rain and highs near 16 C. We must be very close to setting a record low for sunshine as we normally don't get into this persistent gloom around here until late October and November.</div>

TODAY ... A few brighter intervals this morning, then showers more widespread by afternoon, moderate southwest winds picking up gradually to reach 50 to 80 km/hr by late afternoon. Highs 15 to 18 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Windy with occasional rain, 5 to 10 mm likely. Winds south to southwest 60 to 90 km/hr. Lows 11 to 13 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Very windy at times in north Connacht and west Ulster with rain and southwest veering westerly gales 80 to 130 km/hr. Storm force winds possible near coasts and over marine areas around Donegal Bay. Somewhat less extreme elsewhere but certainly wet and windy much of the day, rain tapering to showers by afternoon, winds SW to W 70 to 110 km/hr. Highs 14 to 16 C. About 10 to 15 mm rain likely.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Occasional rain, heavier near south coast, more showery further north, 10 to 20 mm amounts possible. Lows 8 to 10 C and highs 12 to 15 C. Quite windy at times by Thursday night, west to northwest 60 to 90 km/hr. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Cold and windy with passing squally showers, winds west to northwest 70 km/hr at times, lows near 5 C and highs 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Quite cold to start the day with possible frosts inland, then increasing cloud, winds gradually increasing from southwest. Lows about 2 to 5 C and highs 13 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Some guidance is showing the wind gradient becoming very strong by early Sunday morning to about mid-day with potential for gusts to 120 km/hr. This situation will need to be watched, part of the energy for the low comes from former hurricane Florence although that circulation is not fully absorbed and remains further back in the central Atlantic. At the least, it should be a windy and showery day with some clearing later, highs near 14 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Rather cool but settled, some chance of frosts, highs 13 to 15 C early part of next week, with a gradual warming trend towards 20 C later in the week, generally dry with some sunshine each day (24-28 September), the next round of showery and windy weather then following by end of the month into early October when it looks set to turn quite chilly again.<br />

<b><i>ALERT for very strong wind gusts in parts of west and north this morning, peak gusts of 130 km/hr could bring down trees and cause minor structural damage. Driving is not advised in these counties until the storm passes early this afternoon -- most of Connacht, west and north Ulster, Clare and some parts of Kerry, Limerick and Cork. Conditions elsewhere will be slightly less severe but some strong gusts are possible, drive with caution.</i></b><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Becoming very windy from about 0700h on west coast and 0800h Donegal Bay into west Ulster, southwest gale to storm force winds of 80 to 130 km/hr. Very gusty with some intervals of damaging winds and some relatively calm moments, but in general the strongest winds should move through by mid-day (2-3 p.m. north Ulster). Further south, quite windy also, southwesterly winds of 70 km/hr gusting at times to 110 km/hr or higher in exposed locations, isolated wind damage possible. The heavier rain overnight will continue to push east through Ulster, east Connacht and north Leinster this morning, further amounts of 5 to 15 mm. Some partial clearing by afternoon with the strong winds becoming more moderate, highs 15 to 18 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Breezy, rather cool, passing showers, winds westerly 50 to 80 km/hr, lows 8 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Mostly cloudy, best chance of any breaks in the north, with isolated showers there, longer intervals of light rain in south, becoming heavier at times by evening. Moderate westerly winds may increase to strong northwest for a time by evening. Highs 13 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Cool and windy with passing showers, some with hail and thunder. Lows near 6 C and highs near 12 C. Winds westerly 40 to 60 km/hr. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Clear and quite chilly to start the day with isolated frosts possible in northeast, becoming overcast around mid-day, strong southeast winds developing, rain setting in by mid-afternoon west and south, evening east and north. Lows 2 to 5 C and highs 12 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Very windy at times, rain or drizzle, with the low tracking through the south, winds may back to northeast 50 to 80 km/hr over much of the country and then come around to strong north to northwest as the low pulls away into south Wales and southwest England. These stronger winds could produce some gusts to 100 km/hr or higher. Temperatures rather low all day, steady around 8 to 10 C, but feeling very cold due to the wind and rain. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Clearing rapidly overnight then sunny but cool during the daytime, moderate northerly winds, isolated showers near Irish Sea. Lows near 4 C and highs near 11 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Dry, with a slow warming trend to about Friday, eventually highs will recover to 17-19 C. Nights will generally be frosty except in far west and north due to more widespread low cloud there. Beyond next week, models are suggesting a cold and windy start to October.<br />

<br />
TODAY ... Intervals of light rain near south coast, becoming heavier for a time this afternoon and spreading further north, 5 to 15 mm expected. Some sunny breaks in central and northern counties, isolated showers later with the rain pushing into some central counties for part of the afternoon. Rather cool, highs only 13 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Becoming windy at times, west to northwest 50 to 80 km/hr, occasional rain ending towards morning. Lows 4 to 7 C. <br />

FRIDAY ... Variable cloud, cool, passing showers with some hail or thunder possible. Highs 11 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... A clear and cold start with scattered frost possible in north Leinster, Ulster. Lows 2 to 5 C. Increasing cloud from southwest during the day, rain spreading into some southwestern counties, strong east winds developing by evening. Highs only 10 to 13 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Rain at times in at least the southern half of the country, possibly further north depending on storm track (which continues to be shown south of Cork on most guidance). Strong east to northeast winds will back to west then northwest as the low intensifies and moves away towards southern Britain. Rather chilly especially in any combination of wind and rain. Temperatures steady 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Partial clearing, chilly, some scattered inland frosts, sunny intervals for the day, lows 1 to 4 C and highs 10 to 13 C. <br />

TUESDAY ... Sunny intervals, morning frost, lows -1 to +3 C and highs 11 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Hazy sunshine, somewhat milder, lows 1 to 4 C and highs 14 to 18 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Rather than lasting several days, this milder spell may be quickly replaced by a rebuilding cool high with the same sequence from Thursday to about the weekend of 29th-30th. The first week to ten days of October currently appear very cool with a northerly flow, temperatures likely to be well below average in the 7 to 10 C range. <br />

TODAY ... Variable cloud, cool, passing showers with some hail or thunder possible. These have organized in two bands, one moving southeast from the midlands, and the other moving southeast from central Ulster. The trend will be towards more isolated shower activity by afternoon and general clearing by this evening. Occasional westerly wind gusts to about 80 km/hr will also tend to subside later. Highs 11 to 14 C. <br />

<br />
SATURDAY ... A clear and cold start with scattered frost possible in north Leinster, Ulster. Lows 2 to 5 C. Increasing cloud from southwest during the day, rain spreading into some southwestern counties, strong east winds developing by evening. Highs only 10 to 13 C. The rain will then extend across the south overnight into Sunday morning with strong east winds spreading further north, temperatures steady 7 to 9 C. <i>The autumn equinox occurs perhaps a bit later than you might expect, at about 02:56 Irish standard time Sunday 23rd (Saturday evening for anyone reading this in North America).</i><br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Rain at times in the southern half of the country during the morning hours, possibly further north depending on storm track (which still continues to be shown south of Cork on most guidance). Strong east to northeast winds 50 to 80 km/hr will back to north then northwest as the low intensifies and moves away towards southern Britain. Somewhat less windy by afternoon with partial clearing from the northwest. Rather chilly especially in any (early) combination of wind and rain. Temperatures steady 8 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Partial clearing, chilly, some scattered inland frosts, sunny intervals for the day, lows 1 to 4 C and highs 10 to 13 C. Occasional moderate northwest wind gusts to about 50 km/hr.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Sunny intervals, morning frost, lows -1 to +3 C and highs 11 to 14 C. Light winds.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Hazy sunshine, somewhat milder, lows 1 to 4 C and highs 14 to 18 C. Light to moderate southwest winds increasing later in the day at least in northern counties. Light rain by evening in parts of the north.<br />

FRIDAY ... Sunny intervals, slight risk of showers in east Ulster, lows near 4 C and highs near 14 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... The fair weather should hold through most of the weekend of 29th-30th and then a more unsettled northerly flow will bring quite cold weather for early October, highs only in the 7 to 10 C range, and sometimes quite windy with showers that could contain hail. <br />

THURSDAY ... Brief and light showers in parts of east Ulster, north Leinster, rather breezy throughout the country with intervals of cloud and sun, longer sunny breaks in southwest, lows near 7 C and highs near 15 C. Winds northwest 40 to 60 km/hr. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Sunny intervals, more cloud with slight risk of showers in northeast Ulster, lows 2 to 5 C and highs near 14 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY (29th) ... Increasing cloud, showers by evening, highs near 15 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY (30th) ... Overcast, windy, showers, turning colder. Highs near 10 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Some rather cold days at times in early October, mixed with intervals of wind and rain with near normal temperatures. Overall, the next two or three weeks will likely average 1 to 2 degrees below normal and this will lead to a fairly rapid advance of the autumn season with leaf fall and colour change proceeding rather steadily.<br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday was overcast and chilly with light rain and highs only near 11 C. It was a lot warmer in eastern regions of North America, and a strong cold front passing through Ottawa led to a damaging tornado estimated at EF-3 that tracked through western suburbs and across the Ottawa River into Gatineau, Quebec. Temperatures ahead of this front were as high as 32 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rain across parts of the south will end before mid-day and most central counties will stay dry, with some sunshine at times, cloud mostly of the mid-level variety. Further north there will be a few passing showers across much of Ulster into parts of north Leinster, amounts likely to be 1 to 3 mm at most. Moderate northwest winds 40 to 60 km/hr will add some chill to the rather cool temperatures, peaking at only 11 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clearing, light winds, scattered frost inland. Lows -2 to +3 C. Slight risk of fog patches in some valleys especially near rivers and lakes (which will be a lot warmer than the air, hence the saturation of cool air picking up some moisture from them). <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... A crisp, mostly sunny autumn day with light winds and highs 11 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Another cold morning with frost and fog patches, then sunny for the southern and some central counties, increasing cloud across the north with patchy light rain by afternoon there. Lows -2 to +4 C and highs 12 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Hazy sunshine in south, variable cloud further north, a few outbreaks of light rain or drizzle near a stalled frontal boundary close to the north Ulster coast. Lows 2 to 6 C south, 6 to 10 C north, and highs generally 16 to 19 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Turning slightly cooler from north to south, with partly cloudy to overcast skies, but some decent sunshine likely in south. Lows about 7 C and highs 14 to 18 C, warmer in south. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, lows near 5 C and highs near 15 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Increasing cloud, rain by evening, lows near 5 C and highs near 16 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY (30th) ... Overcast, breezy, a few showers and a little cooler, lows near 7 C and highs 12 to 14 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Rather bland weather similar to the second half of the week will continue with some interruptions for a day or two from colder northerly intrusions, so overall it should be a little cooler than average and generally rather dry but with some brief moderate rain showers with frontal passages into early-mid October. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was overcast with passing showers, and highs near 16 C.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... A crisp, mostly sunny autumn day with light winds and highs 11 to 14 C. Some higher cloud will encroach from the northwest reaching parts of Connacht, west Ulster and possibly further into central counties at times, sunshine will be more continuous further south.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear intervals in the south, a good view of the full moon (timed for 0354h), scattered frost may return in a few southern valleys, lows -1 to +3 C. Mostly cloudy further north, lows 3 to 7 C.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Another cold morning with frost and fog patches, then sunny for the southern and some central counties, increasing cloud across the north with patchy light rain by late morning afternoon there, possibly a few sprinkles of rain as far south as central counties but not much if any accumulation. Lows -2 to +4 C and highs 12 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Hazy sunshine in south, variable cloud further north, a few outbreaks of light rain or drizzle near a stalled frontal boundary close to the north Ulster coast. Lows 2 to 6 C south, 6 to 10 C north, and highs generally 16 to 20 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Turning slightly cooler from north to south, with partly cloudy to overcast skies, but some decent sunshine likely in south. Lows about 7 C and highs 14 to 20 C, warmer in south. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, lows near 5 C and highs near 17 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Increasing cloud, rain by evening in north, lows near 5 C and highs near 17 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY (30th) ... Partly cloudy, breezy, a few showers and a little cooler, lows near 7 C and highs 13 to 16 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Projections seem to be changing slightly towards a more prolonged settled period of weather although some of the models still allow colder air to have brief domination between spells of near average temperatures and dry weather with sunshine. <br />
<br />
My local weather is slowly improving, as a large field of cloud and moisture over western Canada loses energy each day allowing a bit more sunshine to intrude, we saw some blue sky at times and some light showers, with highs near 18 C on Sunday.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rather cloudy in most places for the morning hours, with sporadic light rain perhaps 3 to 5 mm in west and north, lesser or trace amounts for east and south. This weak disturbance will have pushed through all but east Ulster and north Leinster by mid-day with a gradual clearing trend and some fairly warm, hazy sunshine in places south of a Galway to Meath line, highs reaching 17 or 18 C. Further north the top temperatures may be held down by more frequent cloud to 14 or 15 C. Sometimes a little breezy with this passing system, south to southwest winds 30 to 50 km/hr, but tending to lighter winds by afternoon.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partly cloudy in central and northern counties, perhaps a few remnant sprinkles of rain, lows 6 to 8 C. Clear intervals, misty or foggy in some valleys further south, lows 3 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Hazy sunshine in south, variable cloud further north, a few outbreaks of light rain or drizzle near a stalled frontal boundary close to the north Ulster coast, but dry almost everywhere else for most of the day, with highs generally 16 to 20 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Turning slightly cooler from north to south, with partly cloudy to overcast skies, but some decent sunshine likely in south. Lows about 7 C and highs 14 to 20 C, warmer in south. As the cooler air filters in from the north, sea fog could move inland from Donegal Bay into north Connacht, reaching inland parts of Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim before dissipating. The frontal boundary will be rather vaguely defined by a band of low cloud that will tend to break up after reaching the midlands.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy to sunny, lows 2 to 5 C with a returning risk of frost in some low-lying areas, and highs 14 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Increasing cloud, rain by evening in north, lows 2 to 5 C and highs 14 to 17 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY (30th) ... Partly cloudy to sunny in the south, breezy in parts of the north where a few showers could develop, turning a little cooler at least in northern counties, lows near 7 C and highs 13 to 16 C.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... The week of 1 to 5 October is looking dry and near normal in temperature, with some risk of frost most nights, highs 12 to 15 C. The influence of high pressure will fade late in the week and into the following weekend, with more of a cold northerly influence replacing the high, and some quite cold (for mid-October) weather appears possible. <br />
<br />
My local weather was fairly pleasant on Monday with a mixture of sun and patchy low cloud producing brief showers of drizzly light rain, highs reaching 17 C. The last of this persistent cloud should break up here on Tuesday and it's already fairly clear overnight with a good view of the full moon.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

<br />
TODAY ... Some hazy sunshine at times, while a weak frontal boundary will bring low cloud and patchy drizzle from north to south during the late morning (north) to afternoon (midlands), that to be followed by partial clearing again but cooler temperatures in northerly breezes 30 to 50 km/hr. Highs 16 to 18 C south, 13 to 15 C north, about 15 or 16 C central. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clearing, some mist and fog patches, and frost in valleys, lows -2 to +3 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Sunny intervals, cool. Highs 12 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Increasing cloud, some drizzle or light rain in north at times, moderate westerly winds developing 30 to 50 km/hr. Lows 2 to 6 C and highs 11 to 15 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY and MONDAY will be cool, partly cloudy days with a slight risk of brief showers in the north, moderate northwest winds, lows near 4 C and highs near 12 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... By mid-week (around 2-4 October) somewhat milder again with chance of rain in the north but hazy sunshine in the south, highs could reach 19 or 20 C briefly, then much cooler for a day or two starting around Friday 5th with gusty northwest winds and scattered rain or hail showers. That cooler turn will be followed by milder weather with increasing chances for more significant rainfalls. <br />
<br />
My local weather was dry and mild (17 C) with mostly cloudy skies, some sunny breaks, and calm winds most of the day. We have some very nice autumn colours in this region now.</div>

MONDAY to WEDNESDAY will then become quite mild again with highs near 18 C and frequent rain that could be rather heavy at times especially in north and west (will be watching for possible heavy amounts above 50 mm in Connacht, certainly 30 mm seems likely at this early stage, 15 to 25 mm elsewhere and possibly more also). Following that wet spell, somewhat cooler by Thursday but eventually becoming quite unsettled and windy at times, rather mild for mid-October with highs often around 15 C and potential for strong wind gusts from south to southwest with passing lows tracking near Donegal Bay from the southwest. <br />
<br />
My local weather has been raw, wet and sometimes windy with rain most of the time and highs only 8 to 10 C. However, we are not doing as badly as southern Alberta where 35 cms of snow fell on Tuesday, leading to chaos on the roads in Calgary. We do have some snowfall accumulations on higher portions of highways in southern B.C. and widespread 10-20 cm amounts further north in central B.C., as unseasonably cold arctic air continues to feed south from the central arctic islands. This early pattern may anchor the hemispheric winter weather response, something I'm considering as part of the work towards a winter long-range forecast (hoping to have that ready within a week to ten days).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Becoming mostly cloudy, rain developing, lows near 8 C and highs 14 to 17 C. About 10 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the western, central and northern counties with more sustained falls expected mid-day to early evening, before that the rain may be quite light and scattered.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain slowly becoming more confined to southern counties, gradual clearing for parts of the north where lows may fall to 3 to 6 C, more cloud central and misty or drizzly further south with lows 6 to 9 C.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Variable cloud, cool, rain mostly confined to south with a chance for a few intervals of moderate rain in southeast by late in the day (this more likely offshore now and into southern Britain for Saturday morning), then stronger northerly winds overnight into Saturday morning 40 to 60 km/hr at times. Highs around 11 C north, to about 14 C in west Munster, otherwise generally about 12 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Windy and rather cold with gradual clearing after some morning rain in east, morning lows 3 to 5 C and highs 10 to 12 C, winds northerly 50 to 80 km/hr. A sharp frost is likely Saturday night with lows -3 to +2 C by Sunday morning.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Increasing cloud in north and west, sunny south and east, somewhat milder by afternoon and evening, highs near 15 C. Moderate southwest winds across northern coastal counties by afternoon accompanied by low cloud and some outbreaks of rain but these should be confined to north Donegal, Derry and Antrim mostly until late overnight into Monday morning.<br />
<br />
MONDAY to WEDNESDAY will then become quite mild again with highs near 18 C and frequent rain that could be rather heavy at times especially in north and west (will be watching for possible heavy amounts above 50 mm in Connacht, certainly 30 mm seems likely at this early stage, 15 to 25 mm elsewhere and possibly more also). By late Wednesday, an Atlantic low (ahead of Leslie) will track close to Donegal Bay and could bring strong wind gusts to the northwestern counties. The effects appear rather confined to coastal Connacht and west Ulster at this point.<br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Following that wet spell, there may be brief clearing but continued quite mild to warm southwest winds as remnants of Hurricane Leslie emerge from a long meandering journey in the central Atlantic and swerve to the north just to the west of Irish coastal waters, possibly this encounter will be close enough to bring a period of gale or storm force wind gusts although the main effect may be to prolong the warm spell expected and perhaps bring temperatures even a bit higher towards 20 C, then even after these strong winds retreat towards Iceland a rather mild pattern appears set to continue for some time through mid-October with more of a settled theme, possibly quite foggy at night during that phase, but highs still generally above average 14 to 17 C.  <br />
<br />
My local weather &quot;improved&quot; to overcast but dry with a very low snow line but still nothing falling at our elevation, and highs only 8 to 10 C. Persistent cloud at the moment is preventing frost but if it clears tomorrow then it could easily fall to -4 C overnight. Meanwhile remnants of former Hurricane Rosa from the Pacific moved into southern Arizona on Tuesday and brought flooding rainfalls as well as setting a new October rainfall record for Phoenix (of almost 60 mm). There were reports of 130 mm of rain near the Arizona border with Mexico, almost an average year's fall for those arid regions. This storm has dissipated now and is just a frontal wave moving northeast into the central plains states.</div>
