Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rather windy and cold with passing mixed wintry showers, more likely to be snow in higher parts of Connacht and most of Ulster, and some new 3-5 cm accumulations are likely there by tonight. Elsewhere, more of a mix of different types of precipitation, and not quite as much potential for a snowfall event as we saw on Tuesday but some will get 1-3 cm later today. Temperatures steady 4-6 C to mid-afternoon then falling to 2-4 C. Winds west-northwest 50-80 km/hr adding a chill to those values. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Widespread snow showers likely, but some mixing with sleet or hail near coasts, rain showers near south coast, lows -1 to +2 C. Winds continuing rather blustery, westerly 40-70 km/hr. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Breezy and cold, mixed wintry showers with the snow component diminishing over the day, as temperatures come up slightly towards 5-7 C. There may be an interval of snow showers in north and east Ulster towards evening from a rather limited area of low pressure passing by to their north.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Some frost to start, then cloudy with outbreaks of rain becoming rather heavy towards evening, lows near -1 C and highs near 8 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Rain at times, very mild, highs 11-13 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY and TUESDAY will continue quite mild with highs 10-12 C. There will be further outbreaks of rain. <br />
<br />
The outlook for the rest of the week is unsettled and windy with colder temperatures and a slight risk of snow again although with readings of 4-7 C it's likely to be limited to higher terrain. But there may be one period with more widespread snow around Thursday night (a week from today).<br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday continued rather mild (for here) with highs near 3 C and some rain began at sunset, mixing with wet snow close to us at slightly higher elevations. The minor snow event has moved on from New England and some parts of North Carolina got snow from a trailing system. You may have heard on the news that there have been temperatures below -60 C in parts of eastern Siberia and readings below -50 are quite widespread there today. <br />
<br />
In Australia, hot and dry for most of the central and inland southeast, not quite fully affecting Sydney yet (30 C) but near 40 C in both Melbourne and Adelaide earlier today (they are approaching sunset there now).</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Partly cloudy, passing wintry showers, best chances for snow in higher parts of Ulster and a few locations in Connacht, Munster. Some localized 3-5 cm accumulations there. Otherwise most locations are more likely to see sleet or hail showers. Strong westerly winds dying out gradually by afternoon, highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear intervals and cold in north, east, frosts around midnight with icy stretches on some roads, lows -2 to +2 C. Rain or drizzle developing across parts of south and west, turning to sleet on hills and some snow possible at first, temperatures rising slowly to about 3 or 4 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... The rain or sleet will make further progress north although moving more to the east before dying out mid-day. Snow only likely on higher terrain in this mixture. Some brighter intervals developing with heavier rain moving in from the southwest by evening. Highs later in the day 7 to 10 C (4 to 7 C east Ulster, north Leinster). About 10-20 mm of rain in total from the two systems in the south, less further north.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Very mild for most with some further rain, then partial clearing, highs about 11 to 13 C. It may stay closer to 5 C in parts of Ulster with dense fog developing over snow-covered areas (snow gradually melting). <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Sunny intervals, highs 8 to 10 C. Some showers in northwest by late in the day. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Occasional rain, mild, breezy. Highs 10 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Rather windy and turning colder, showers becoming mixed by evening, temperatures near 10 C at first then falling to 2-4 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Breezy and cold with scattered wintry showers, highs 3 to 6 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... More settled than the previous days with near normal temperatures but some cold nights as clearer skies prevail. <br />
<br />
My local weather cleared up briefly for a great view of the local peaks. There's a picture to illustrate that at the end of today's report. Some passing rain showers too, and highs near 6 C. Nothing too active anywhere across North America at the moment. <br />
<br />
In Australia, the heat in the southeast is being moderated near coastlines by sea breezes, rather than just blasting into Sydney as sometimes happens, so it's about 28 C there and 40 C inland, but that extends across northern Victoria and most of NSW into South Australia. Western Australia is returning to more normal hot midsummer temperatures after quite a cool spell due to cloud and rain from a tropical cyclone. <br />
<br />
Just to underscore why we were concerned about the windy frontal passage early Thursday morning, it really blew up into a hurricane-force storm over the North Sea and hit the Netherlands very hard with gusts over 140 km/hr in places. I'm sure that's fairly prominent on the news there (didn't notice any coverage here so far, quite often we see European weather stories a day or two later and they get the full climate change treatment. As bad as this was, not much comparison to the 1st Feb 1953 storm which was already very strong when it passed Ireland 30-31 Jan (causing a ferry to sink with great loss of life) then of course it did enormous damage in eastern England and Holland, leading to the deaths by drowning of about two thousand people, and soon afterwards their building program of defensive sea walls. And back in medieval times, entire islands north of Holland sometimes disappeared with catastrophic loss of life in severe windstorms. Some of those events had death tolls that might have reached tens of thousands.</div>

<br />
Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Some drizzle or light sleet in parts of the north (snow in Northern Ireland) this morning should slowly clear with some persistent fog or mist and continuing rather cold temperatures except in Munster where milder air and rain will move in with the rain becoming heavier as it moves further north by late afternoon. Highs 3 to 6 C in many parts of the north and east, 8 to 10 C in the southwest. About 10-15 mm of rain possible. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain will be heavy at times (10-20 mm) and will change to sleet or wet snow over parts of Ulster, as the milder air takes several hours to push all the way through Ulster. Temperatures steady 8-10 C in the south, and rising to about 7 C further north by dawn. Dense fog is likely in some rural areas and over any melting snow cover in the north. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Rain ending by mid-day then partly cloudy and mild. Highs 11-13 C in the south, 7 to 10 C north. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... A few early morning showers, then partly cloudy during the day, lows about 4 C and highs about 9 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Mild with occasional rain, but turning colder late in the day. Highs near 10 C, temperatures falling to 3-4 C by evening. About 10 mm of rain expected. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Windy and rather cold with frequent showers, and the risk of an interval of heavier rain especially for southern counties. Potential for 20-40 mm rainfalls. Highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Windy and very cold with wintry showers, falls of snow on higher terrain. Highs 3 to 6 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Turning quite mild again by Friday and into the following weekend. This mild spell may break down from within rather than due to any colder air pushing in from a distance; as the high pressure area circulating the mild air drifts closer to Ireland, it may reduce the wind to almost calm which could lead to dense fog and colder nights. Then eventually cold air will move in from further north, clearing the fog but keeping it rather cold as the month ends. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday was mild with light rain and fog, highs reaching 5 C. <br />
<br />
Heat continues across most of Australia although Melbourne and Tasmania are in a cooler flow from the south. Most places apart from the tropical north remain dry.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rain ending by mid-day as any remaining sleet changes to rain in Ulster, then partly cloudy and mild from mid-morning hours in the south and closer to early afternoon further north. It may remain quite foggy until the rain ends, and possibly for a time afterwards in cooler areas of the north. Highs 11-13 C in the south, 7 to 10 C north. Moderate southwest breezes 40-60 km/hr at times.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partly cloudy, isolated showers, mild, lows 4-7 C.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... A few early morning showers, then partly cloudy during the day, some eastern and southern counties turning out sunny by afternoon, lows about 4 C and highs about 9 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Mild with occasional rain, but turning colder late in the day. Highs near 10 C, temperatures falling to 3-4 C by evening. About 10 mm of rain expected. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Windy and rather cold with frequent showers, and the risk of an interval of heavier rain especially for southern counties. Potential for 15-25 mm rainfalls. Lows 2 to 4 C and highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Windy and very cold with wintry showers, falls of snow on higher terrain. Lows -1 to +2 C and highs 4 to 7 C. Temperatures appear a bit marginal for widespread wintry showers so that areas near sea level will probably see more rain or hail than sleet or snow. Some snow is likely to accumulate on higher ground.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Turning quite mild again by Friday and into the following weekend. This mild spell may break down from within rather than due to any colder air pushing in from a distance; as the high pressure area circulating the mild air drifts closer to Ireland, it may reduce the wind to almost calm which could lead to dense fog and colder nights. Then eventually cold air will move in from further north, clearing the fog but keeping it rather cold as the month ends. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was partly to mostly cloudy and mild with highs around 7 C. Our snow has slumped down to about 15 cms now and large snowbanks are melting slowly. Up a little higher though, still quite good winter sports conditions as the pack was deeper there and these temperatures register closer to 2-4 C on the hillsides. Meanwhile, it is turning quite spring-like in central and eastern regions of North America ahead of a spring-like storm that will bring snow to the northern plains and upper Great Lakes next two days, but just rain showers along a cold front further south; however, it will turn considerably colder around Tuesday. <br />
<br />
The heat wave continues in most of Australia and fires are beginning to break out in parts of New South Wales and Victoria. Highs of 35-40 C are widespread although some moderation from sea breezes is helping Sydney and Melbourne residents. <br />
<br />
Here's one more international note of interest to you weather enthusiasts -- extreme high pressure has formed over north-central Siberia, a recent map I saw had a central pressure of 1069 mbs well to the north of Novosibirsk. Temperatures near this massive high are generally around -40 to -50 C, not that unusual for the region, it's more the pressure reading that's a bit out of the ordinary. You see a lot of 1040 or 1050 mb highs in Siberia but occasionally they get past 1060 mbs. That latter figure is considered exceptionally high in North America, in the 178 years of records at Toronto the highest is about 1057 mbs. I think the record in Ireland is about 1053 or 1054 mbs, perhaps somebody can quote the exact number. No sign of that strong Siberian high moving west, or in any particular direction. It links up to less impressive highs in northeast Siberia and Alaska. Everywhere underneath that chain of highs is around -35 to -45 C. Again, that's not unusual, temperatures often fall to about -55 C or lower in parts of Alaska and Yukon.</div>

&#8220;In winter time, on the other hand, high pressure is more likely to be found over the cold continents - especially over the vast land areas of eastern Russia where the Siberian winter anticyclone is a dominant feature of the global weather pattern.<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, therefore, it was there in Siberia that the highest pressure ever measured was recorded - 1084 hPa on December 31st, 1968, at a place called Agata, when the temperature was a chilling minus 46 Celsius.<br />
<br />
Five other weather stations in the vicinity recorded similarly high pressure values, thus almost eliminating any possibility of error.&#8221;<br />

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy this morning, generally dry, then some sunny intervals developing by afternoon, highs<br />
8-11 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain at times, southwest winds increasing to 40-70 km/hr. Lows 4-6 C.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Partly cloudy, blustery southwest winds 60-100 km/hr, passing showers but some brighter intervals. Highs near 10 C early in the day, temperatures may be sliding down into the 3-6 C range by evening when there may be an interval of stronger winds (southwest 80-110 km/hr). This may be confined to coastal west and south or could spread a little more widely inland Tuesday night. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Windy and rather cold with showers turning to hail with the risk of thunder, winds southwest 50-80 km/hr, morning lows 2-5 C and afternoon highs about 7 or 8 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Breezy and colder with passing wintry showers, winds turning northwesterly 40-70 km/hr, morning lows 1-3 C and afternoon highs 4-7 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Frosty to start, some sunny intervals then overcast with light rain by late in the day, lows -3 to +2 C and highs 8 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... The weekend is likely to be quite mild and generally dry, except perhaps for rain near the north coast. Highs 10-12 C expected. This milder spell will gradually transition to somewhat cooler days and cold nights associated with extensive high pressure not very far south or west of Ireland, possibly even right over the country at times, which could lead to some days where fog becomes persistent. That spell would be more likely to break down into some kind of colder northerly flow eventually but that could be a week into February. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday was overcast with light rain and somewhat windy at times, the distant effects of a powerful coastal storm that did considerable damage around Vancouver and Seattle with gusts over 100 km/hr. It was about 3 C here so a slow thaw continues. Further east, one or two more days of very mild weather will break on Tuesday near the east coast with a sharp drop in temperatures. Snow extends from Denver to about Duluth, MN into northern Ontario. <br />
<br />
In Australia, heat wave conditions today were pushed all the way north from Victoria and southern parts of New South Wales by a front that produced some thunderstorms, only near 20 C south of this front, but it remains quite hot further north (35-40 C), Sydney being cooled slightly by sea breezes.</div>

TONIGHT ... Continued very windy with rain resuming around midnight, becoming rather heavy at times towards morning, lows 4-7 C. Winds southwest 70-100 km/hr after peak gusts earlier in the night.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Breezy to windy, somewhat colder with frequent showers, winds south to southwest 50-80 km/hr, highs 7-10 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Colder with passing showers, some of them becoming wintry on hills in north, morning lows 2-4 C and highs 6-8 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Frosty to start, then increasing cloud, light rain at times by evening. Lows -3 to +2 C and highs 7 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
WEEKEND ... Cloudy with a few sunny intervals, mild, becoming quite windy by later Sunday with rain near north coast, highs both days 10-12 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... Mild with showers and strong westerly winds on Monday, then turning colder in stages, as it now appears that the Atlantic high may stay further out to sea (guidance is still mixed on this), and quite cold by end of the month into early February, with some colder days still possible in the first week of February. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Monday was overcast with light rain and highs near 5 C. Heavy snow has fallen in parts of the upper Midwest and this is moving into north-central Ontario, as the mild spell further south comes to an abrupt end later today. <br />
<br />
In Australia, the front mentioned yesterday has drifted a bit further north and brought thunderstorms to Sydney, with the full heat wave conditions now pushed into central and northern NSW and SA. The front loses definition west of Lake Eyre so that tropical heat now covers most of the west as well as north-central regions with the summer monsoon thunderstorms widely scattered across the far north.</div>

		<div>UPDATE __ Tues 23 Jan 2018 __ 6 p.m.<br />
_____________________________________<br />
<br />
Strong winds will develop late this evening in all exposed locations, in particular the southwest, south coast and inland southeast where some gusts to 120 km/hr are possible, as storm Georgina (named earlier today) passes by to the north. Usually on this track the stronger winds are found in Connacht and west Ulster, but in this case the winds are being concentrated into a frontal zone so that maximum gusts are likely to be ahead of the system and well to the south. Peak gusts can be expected around 2300h to 0200h across the south. <br />
<br />
Although some gusts to 110 km/hr are likely further north, I think the maximum impact of this event will be in the south this time. <br />
<br />
There is an orange level warning in place and I think this will verify in some of the more exposed locations but for most this will probably peak in the yellow warning range. Dublin may see some local windshadow effects from this wind direction and western to northern parts of the capital region may be more exposed than places closer to the Dublin mountains. A strong southerly wind may precede the southwest gales across parts of the Irish Sea coastline.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<i>ALERT for flooding after 15-30 mm rainfalls overnight, some low-lying areas may have standing water and some smaller streams have overflowed their banks so drive with extreme caution especially before full daylight. There is a risk of mudslides in hilly terrain.</i><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Continued rather windy and turning somewhat colder, with frequent passing showers producing some hail and thunder at times, winds southwest 50-80 km/hr with another interval of strong winds likely by evening. Highs 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Very windy at times (southwest to west 80-110 km/hr) with showers becoming mixed and wintry on some hills by morning. Lows 2-5 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Windy and cold with passing showers, some wintry on higher terrain in Connacht and Ulster. Hail may be as likely as rain at lower elevations. Winds turning northwesterly 50-70 km/hr, highs only 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Frosty to start, lows -3 to +2 C. Increasing cloud during the day, moderate westerly winds developing, and milder by evening with occasional rain, highs 7 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Mostly cloudy, breezy and mild, highs near 11 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Partly cloudy, breezy and mild, rain may brush north coast, highs near 12 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Turning somewhat colder in the first part of next week, as winds turn more to northwest, but this appears likely to be a glancing blow of colder air headed mainly for Britain and central Europe, highs may not fall much below 8 C before heading back up again at the end of the week. More potent cold outbreaks are possible later towards the second week of February. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Tuesday was overcast and a bit colder with light snow at times and a high of -1 C. <br />
<br />
Looking at Australia, the recent heat wave has subsided back into central regions and a weak front runs east-west through New South Wales with one severe storm complex north of Sydney near Putty.</div>

The weekend will be quite mild with occasional outbreaks of light rain mostly overnight and morning hours, somewhat better chances for bright intervals in the afternoons, and highs near 12 C.<br />
<br />
Monday to Wednesday will see a gradual cooling trend as winds become more northwesterly, and there should be a bit more sunshine than many recent days, with brief intervals of sleety rain that could mix with snow on higher ground, highs eventually in the 6-8 C range.<br />
<br />
After that, with the new month, it will be back to milder weather for a few days but there continues to be the promise of quite cold weather into the second week of February from more of a northeasterly source than has been the case with earlier cold spells that were mostly northwesterly or northerly.<br />
<br />
As I am now at the coast to attend a family wedding then one last slog of moving belongings back to the new home base, I will have to prevail on my fellow Boards weather friends to post a few forecasts until perhaps Wednesday 31st, thanks in advance. Readers, you might expect to find forecasts then at somewhat different times of day than I am able to manage being in my evening time zone about now. ... my local weather is sleety rain that will probably change to snow in the morning then back to rain. I know it sounds appealing and you might want to book a flight, but hold off because four straight days of rain are coming  and this may draw in quite a crowd.</div>

<br />
<i>Sorry this is running late, I had forgotten to post my forecast here on the thread.</i><br />
<br />
TODAY .... Mostly cloudy with some sunny spells in scattered eastern regions. Strong southwesterlies feeding in some very mild air for the time of year. Maximums of 10-13c. If you catch any glimpse of sunshine, it could help to raise temperatures higher than 13c but very unlikely.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT .... Very windy with already gusty southwesterlies strengthening further ahead of a band of persistent rain pushing southwards as the night goes on. Very mild ahead of the rain with minimums not getting much below 10c. However, as the rain clears, temperatures will drop somewhat to the mid single figures of 4-6c in the north. <br />
<br />
MONDAY .... A cooler day with some heavy rain to start in the south and east clearing during the morning hours before a window of drier and clearer conditions moves down from the northwest with only a few isolated showers. Winds moderate coming from a northwesterly airstream giving off to maximums of 5-8c. Clear skies on Monday night will lead to some icy and frosty conditions, particularly down in the south. Cloud cover across some other parts will help keep temperatures up.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY .... Cloudier day generally with thick cloud leading to drizzle in some localised spots. You might be lucky to catch some sunny spells though. Maximums of 5-9c. The cloud will be followed by some rain to come Tuesday night. It will get quite patchy as it moves southeastwards. Wintry showers and some clearer conditions will arrive behind the front. Even with the rain, it will feel chilly everywhere courtesy of the gusty westerlies.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY .... The wind will be the main story of the day with the wind chill making it feel bitter. Sunshine and showers with some potential snow over higher ground in parts of Connacht and Ulster, mostly of hail and sleet though. Maximums of only 2-6c generally.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY .... Similar to Wednesday, it will be a blustery day with sunshine and showers. However, the wind will be relatively lighter on Thursday making it feel not as cold as Wednesday. Maximums of 4-7c.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY .... Milder start to the day before rain pushes down from the northwest introducing cooler again behind it. Sunshine and showers in the cooler air. Maximums of 6-10c initially but dropping to 5-7c generally after. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY .... Mostly dry and sunny before some rain later on. Maximums of 5-7c.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK .... Everything continues to be up in the air regarding February. The models are certainly on the cold outlook. The GFS 06z earlier today for example was showing an easterly next week, then high pressure over us - meaning anticyclonic gloom - before it would then retrogress up to Greenland well into FI. <br />
<br />
There seems to be an unusual warming that is consistent on the previous few GFS runs for around the 11th-13th February. The PV is getting displaced over Canada with much of Northern Europe having a warming event in the stratosphere. The closest match I've found through the archives to what the model has been showing is from February 1982. February 1982 was a mild month along with a mild Spring, so that doesn't look like terribly good news for cold lovers. I will keep you up to date on this situation on the forum.</div>

<i>I apologise for running late again, this time I had school things to attend to but I hope yesterday's forecast kept you running through for today's weather :P. Somebody else will have to post tomorrow morning if you want a forecast bright and early but if not, I will post it after school.</i><br />
<br />
TONIGHT .... Most places will be clear tonight which will lead to some frost in parts, particularly along eastern and southern regions. In these parts, minimums will get down to -1 or -2c at lowest. Some showers may continue affecting the north and west so temperatures will hold up here around 2 or 3c. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY .... Mostly dry if rather cloudy with thick cloud at times causing drizzle. Chance of hazy sunshine in scattered places, mostly the east. Maximums of 6-9c in fairly moderate southwesterly breezes. Towards the evening, rain will push into the northwest and winds will strengthen. Behind the rain, it will turn colder with wintry showers in the north and west along with quite a widespread frost developing.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY .... A cold blustery day all in all with scattered wintry showers, generally of hail and sleet. Snow still looking like a possibility over higher ground in parts of Connacht and Ulster. Maximums of only 2-6c generally with minimums dropping to -3c possibly on Wednesday night as ice and frost form nationwide.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY .... Less frequent showers and less windy than Wednesday will help skies to be more clear across the country during the day. However, still quite cold with maximums of 4-7c mostly in a northwesterly airstream. A band of rain will push eastwards overnight bringing some snow on higher ground potentially with it.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY .... Quite different to the outlook from yesterday. Whilst it will be a milder day in quite strong southwesterlies, it looks now like it will be mostly settled. However, rain does eventually show its hand Friday night. I think this proves the uncertainty with everything at the moment regarding February.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY .... Rain pushing southwards and becoming quite chilly with plenty of wintry showers behind the rain along with sunny spells. Very windy in a northwesterly airstream. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK .... There is so much uncertainty at the moment that I think it's not worth delving into what's going to happen Saturday afterwards.<br />
<br />
An extraordinary warming event has suddenly appeared on the ECM for as early as next week and yes it's going into the Arctic Circle, it's not the displaced PV that I have been discussing. The fact that the GFS is not showing this is surprising. Usually when it comes to warming events, it's the GFS that hypes them up and shows them to their extreme but the ECM is doing so right now. I cannot confirm if what the ECM is showing would be near SSW levels (which just to be clear in other words means reversing the zonal westerlies) but what I can say is that if it were to come off, it would certainly disturb the PV and northern blocking would get itself going sometime 2 weeks minimum after the initial warming occurrence. <br />
<br />
After a brief disappearance of the PV displacement yesterday, the GFS is now showing it again with the PV over Canada and the warming occurring over northern Europe, honestly I am lost right now with both of these models showing different sorts of warming events. Please keep staying in tune with me if you want to know the effects or updates of any of these stratospheric events. I'm all ears. If you have any questions, don't be afraid to post in the Winter discussion thread.</div>

<b>Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
TONIGHT .... Rain will push down from the northwest and becoming very patchy by the time it reaches the south and east. Winds will freshen at the same time coming from a westerly airstream. A clearance will follow the rain overnight bringing frost and icy patches along with it. Some showers could turn wintry with the potential for snow over high ground. Minimums getting down to -1c at their lowest, generally 1 or 2c. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY .... Widespread showers on a gusty northwesterly flow. Showers will be of hail, sleet, rain and snow over higher ground. There is a yellow warning for some snow and ice tomorrow in Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Louth and Leitrim. Winds generally between 40-60km/hr, though certainly the chance of stronger gusts. Wind warning from Met &#201;ireann is currently yellow for much of the western coastline regions in the range of 55-60km/hr. Maximums generally of 4-6c. However, where you have the snow, temperatures may struggle to reach much above 4c. Quite a blustery day overall ending on a cold night with minimums just above freezing courtesy of the strong winds but the wind chill factor will make it feel far colder.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY .... Another fairly blustery day but winds will be lighter and showers will be less widespread allowing for more sunny spells to develop across regions, especially in the eastern half. It will be a rather milder day with maximums around 6-9c but it will not feel all that mild in the Winter sunshine and especially if you have that bitter northwesterly wind. Thursday night will be very cold with a hard frost forming in minimums getting below 0c quite widely. However, as cloud tries to move in from the west overnight, temperatures will begin to rise here.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY .... Frost clearing during Friday morning with the chance of some hazy sunshine. However, rain will push down from the northwest during the afternoon into the evening. The rain light at first, but will turn heavy and persistent for a time overnight. A windy night, fresh and gusty southwest to west winds will increase strong in places. More showery weather looks set to follow from the Atlantic later in the night and early Saturday morning. Maximums of 6-9c.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY .... Gusty northwesterly winds will bring in a lot of showers across Ireland. These mostly of hail and rain. There seems to be a very slim chance of snow right now if any for Saturday. Sunny spells in between the showers but feeling quite cold in maximums of only 4-7c.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY .... Showers should be less widespread bringing in more sunny spells to be enjoyed. Winds will pay back a touch to moderate northwesterlies in maximums of 6-9c.</div>

So I just got in at the ungodly hour of 0400h and we have a full moon going into total eclipse here, but with a lot of cloud around so just getting the odd glimpse of an almost fully covered lunar orb.<br />
<br />
Had a quick look at the model runs and can see that further cold outbreaks are very likely beyond this one, with limited warming between them as flow mostly from northwest or even north, and just occasionally relaxes a bit to westerly to allow in a slightly milder flow but overall it looks like the first half of February will be 3 to 5 degrees below normal in temperature and fairly dry which must be good news after all the rain recently.<br />
<br />
Will get back in gear for forecasting later but probably won't post until Thursday morning 0600h.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Sunny intervals, cold and breezy with a few passing showers, some of them wintry in higher parts of the north and west. Highs 5 to 7 C. Winds northwest 40 to 60 km/hr. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clearing with widespread frost likely, lows -4 to -1 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Sunny with increasing cloud, light rain in western counties by late in the day, highs 6 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Early morning sleet or snow in parts of east Ulster and Leinster with remnants of earlier rain moving through east Munster and south Leinster, then clearing for a while before widespread wintry showers develop in a very cold northwesterly wind 50-70 km/hr. Morning lows 1 to 3 C then highs only 3 to 5 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Heavy frost will persist for much of the day in some parts, despite some wintry sunshine, increasing cloud towards afternoon and sleet or light rain by evening mostly in western counties. Lows -5 to -2 C and highs 2 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Turning quite cold again Monday and Tuesday of next week, and slow moderation of temperatures later next week although only above average briefly by about Saturday 10th, then a more variable regime with somewhat less of an arctic influence, although the occasional colder day still present. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday was partly sunny and reasonably mild at 4 C. We have a rather crusty 10-15 cm snow cover left with large piles where plows have been active, but this increases to 40-50 cms in nearby higher terrain. The past few days have been reasonably mild in the Midwestern states but colder air is on the way south and will soon be dominating the weather again in eastern as well as central U.S. and Canada while the west remains rather mild generally.<br />
<br />
It appears to have cooled off in Australia since I was reporting on their weather about a week ago -- temperatures late Thursday in most of the major cities are somewhat below normal (generally only in the low 20s although 31 degrees at Perth), seasonable heat is confined to central regions and the north is well into the usual summer monsoon wet season.</div>

THURSDAY could produce a widespread light snowfall depending on how cold the lower levels remain as a weak front tries to push in from the Atlantic, but without much support temperatures may remain close to freezing.

FRIDAY will be partly cloudy and still rather cold, highs near 5 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... There are some indications of a brief milder interval around Saturday when temperatures could reach near normal values (highs 7 to 9 C) but then guidance begins to diverge into many different looking solutions that include some snow by Sunday or Monday. Stay tuned as this longer range outlook is too uncertain to get into specific details yet. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Thursday (back home in the mountains of south central B.C. now) was overcast with large snowflakes drifting down at times, about 5 cm eventual accumulation, and highs near -1 C. A sleety mix is falling on the east coast of the U.S. overnight but snow is restricted to inland hilly areas. Colder air is spreading back into eastern and central regions of North America. <br />
<br />
Down under, the cooler trend continues in most of the larger cities of the southeast, with a front pushing well north of Sydney towards south Queensland. There are some heavy storms in central Queensland in the tropical air mass ahead of that front but little other active weather today.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Some sunny intervals in Leinster amd east Munster this morning, as wintry showers spread into other regions on gusty northwesterly winds of 50-70 km/hr. Temperatures will remain cold in the range of 3 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partial clearing as wintry showers become more confined to coastal districts, by midnight or later mainly near the east coast, with some falls of light snow possible inland at elevations above 200 metres. Quite cold with scattered frosts developing. Lows -2 to +2 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Frost will persist for part of the morning hours in some inland valleys, despite some wintry sunshine, with increasing cloud towards evening in some coastal parts of northwestern counties. Highs 4 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Sharp frosts again for most, although milder under cloud in west, morning lows -5 to +2 C, then increasing cloud, after some sunshine in east, continued cold with sleet or snow developing later in the day, highs 4 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY and WEDNESDAY will return to very cold northerly winds and scattered wintry showers although decent amounts of sunshine likely both days, morning lows about -2 C Tuesday and -6 C Wednesday, afternoon highs both days 2 to 6 C with moderate northerly winds 40-60 km/hr at times, snow accumulations likely on higher ground. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY could produce a widespread light snowfall or mixed rain and wet snow, and intervals of sleet, depending on how cold the lower levels remain as a weak front tries to push in from the Atlantic, but with temperatures remaining low (between 3 and 7 C).. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY will be partly cloudy with wintry showers, moderate northwest winds and still rather cold, lows near -1 C and highs near 5 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... There will likely be a brief milder interval around Saturday 10th when temperatures could reach near normal values (highs 8 to 10 C) with rain at times, but then it appears likely to turn somewhat colder again for the following week, albeit not as cold as this week, with highs of about 6 to 8 C and slight frosts at times.  <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday was foggy with light rain at lower elevations and snow just above our valley floor, about 5 cms new snow received higher up, with highs in the rain near 3 C. <br />
<br />
In Australia, the cooler air from the south has pushed all the way into south Queensland giving Brisbane an unusually cool day (low 20s), but further south, that air mass is heating up to give Melbourne and Adelaide a warmer and sunny day today near 30 C. The only stormy weather appears to be in central Queensland.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<i>ALERTS for severe frosts tonight and accumulating snow (5-8 cm possible) Monday night in central and eastern counties.<br />
</i><br />
TODAY ... Sunny and cold in most places, just a few isolated hail or snow showers moving inland from the Irish Sea between Dublin and Wexford. Highs 4 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Clear and very cold with widespread severe frosts, lows -6 to -2 C. There may be some cloud near west coast and this may hold temperatures closer to zero degrees locally there. Icy stretches on roads in many inland regions.<br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Increasing cloud for west will begin during the morning, but some sunny intervals will persist to early afternoon in the east. It will remain very cold with temperatures between 2 and 6 C by mid-afternoon, coldest inland Leinster and midlands. <br />
<br />
MONDAY NIGHT ... Rain moving into western counties during the evening will quickly turn to sleet and then snow further east, and 5-8 cms could accumulate by morning in many parts of the midlands, Leinster, inland east Munster and southeast Ulster.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Snow or sleet ending, some clearing then more wintry showers or (mainly northwest) intervals of snow in very cold northwest winds 40-70 km/hr. Some sunny intervals also, with highs 2 to 6 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Partly cloudy, wintry showers and cold, morning lows -6 to -3 C, afternoon highs 3 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Snow or sleet likely, temperatures zero to 3 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, very cold, isolated wintry showers, highs near 5 C. Sleet turning to rain overnight. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Milder with gusty southwest winds, rain at times, highs near 10 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Turning much colder again by Sunday 11th, and staying rather cold all week, although probably not quite as cold as this coming week, still some frosts most nights and highs only 5 to 8 C. Further into the month, some rather active but still wintry patterns are showing up, confidence is low on details but there could be further snowfalls to or beyond mid-February. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Saturday was foggy and mild with light rain at times, highs reaching about 4 C. We have colder air poised to move in here tonight and turn this light rain to snow on Sunday. Further east, it has turned quite cold in most places, and a wintry mix is developing over the inland southeast, turning to wet snow in the mid-Atlantic states and then 2-5 cm snowfalls further northeast, not a big storm but a nuisance event that will make highways slippery in many parts of the northeast on Super Bowl Sunday (the game is indoors in Minnesota, outside it will be -15 C so that's just as well). <br />
<br />
Australia appears to be generally fair and warmer today in many parts, as the recent unseasonable cool spell fades out of the picture. Still a little below normal mid-summer temperatures in parts of NSW and QLD.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<i>ALERT for snowfall and icy roads developing in central and eastern counties overnight, 3 to 6 cms expected with potential 5 to 10 cms on higher ground in Wicklow and Dublin. Further wintry showers on Tuesday may bring 2 to 5 cms snowfalls in some parts of the northwest that escape this first round of snowfall.</i><br />
<br />
TODAY ... After a frosty and in some places foggy start to the day, there will be generally increasing cloud during the morning, but some sunny intervals may persist to early afternoon in the east despite patchy low cloud. It will remain very cold with temperatures between 3 and 7 C by mid-afternoon, coldest inland Leinster and midlands. Temperatures will fall back to near -1 C in the east this evening.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain moving into western counties during the late afternoon and evening (3-6 mm) will turn to sleet (inland Galway-Roscommon and parts of west Munster) and then snow further east, and 3-6 cms could accumulate by morning in many parts of the midlands, Leinster, inland east Munster and southeast Ulster. There could be local accumulations of 5 to 10 cms in higher parts of Dublin and Wicklow. There is a slight risk of freezing rain in some central valleys or freezing drizzle mixing into the snowfall, making for a very slippery morning on the roads for Tuesday. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Snow or sleet ending, some clearing then more wintry showers or (mainly northwest) intervals of snow with 2 to 5 cms on some hills in Connacht and west Ulster, in very cold northwest winds 40-70 km/hr. Some sunny intervals also, these more frequent in east and near south coast, with highs only 3 to 6 C (possibly near 8 C in coastal west Munster and near southeast coast). <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Partly cloudy, wintry showers and cold, morning lows -6 to -3 C leading to heavy frosts that may persist well into the morning, then afternoon highs 3 to 7 C. Sleet may turn to rain in west during the late afternoon or evening.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Rain, sleet, or snow during the early morning, then partly cloudy, breezy and rather cold, further wintry showers developing afternoon and evening as winds increase to westerly 40-70 km/hr. Temperatures may be somewhat higher during the early morning hours to almost mid-day (4 to 7 C) then fall back to around  3 to 5 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, cold, isolated wintry showers, highs near 5 C. Sleet turning to rain overnight as temperatures begin to rise towards 8-10 C by Saturday morning. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Milder with gusty southwest winds, rain at times, highs near 10 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Turning much colder again by Sunday 11th, and staying rather cold all week, although probably not quite as cold as this coming week, still some frosts most nights and highs only 5 to 8 C. As long as the flow remains more westerly than northerly, precipitation will be sleety with snow limited to hills mostly. Further into the month, some rather active but still wintry patterns are showing up, confidence is low on details but there could be further snowfalls to or beyond mid-February. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday was foggy with persistent wet snow that began to accumulate as temperatures fell slowly below -2 C, and now we have about 15 cms over the pre-existing saturated 10-15 cm pack (and all the piles of plowed snow are nicely covered up too). I foresee a fair amount of shovelling as part of my Monday, waiting for it to stop first. Very cold air is moving southeast to cover most of central and eastern North America this week, and sleet or snow will push through the inland northeast followed by some lake effect snowfalls but otherwise generally clearing ahead of another weak system expected to bring sleet or snow to parts of the inland northeast by Thursday.<br />
<br />
Seasonably warm and dry weather covers almost all of Australia away from the Darwin region where it's humid with scattered monsoonal storms.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Very cold with gusty northwest winds developing, scattered sleety showers this morning will clear east giving brief sunny spells followed by further wintry showers, and potential for some heavy falls of snow or hail accompanied by thunder in parts of Connacht, west Munster, Ulster, and midlands. Some remnants of these heavier showers may reach east and south coasts but sunshine may be more frequent there. Winds northwest 40-70 km/hr and highs only 3 to 7 C, with temperatures prone to falling close to -1 C during heavier wintry showers. Icy roads in some parts of Leinster this morning, and then developing over inland parts of the north and west by this afternoon where snow or hail accumulates.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partial clearing, wintry showers more confined to coastal northwest, severe frosts likely inland, lows -6 to -3 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Partly cloudy, continuing cold with further wintry showers, then turning a bit milder late in the day with sleet turning to rain in west and north, highs reaching 7 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Milder for a time with rain or showers, highs near 8 C, then turning much colder with snow or sleet showers returning from the northwest as winds veer to that direction, temperatures falling rapidly to near 1 C. Winds west to northwest about 50 to 80 km/hr adding chill especially afternoon and evening.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Windy and cold with passing wintry showers, lows near -2 C and highs near 5 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Hope nobody gets dizzy reading this, turning milder again with southwest winds 50-70 km/hr and rain at times, highs near 11 C, then much colder late in the day as winds veer to westerly 60-90 km/hr. Wintry showers overnight into Sunday. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY and MONDAY ... Windy and cold with occasional snow or hail showers. Highs about 4 C. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... It seems that this pattern is locking in for several weeks and further brief milder intervals can be expected about every third day (at the moment the models are suggesting Tuesday 13th and late in the following week), with colder days between where snow becomes possible. No definite signs of anything easterly in this cold regime, just a succession of very cold maritime arctic air masses that make a fairly fast journey from Greenland to Ireland, with the Atlantic trying to maintain some control with brief milder visitations. There is some bitterly cold air lurking over Scandinavia so if the wind ever does turn northeasterly, even colder weather could follow. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Monday was overcast but fairly bright and just a few light flurries of snow with highs near 2 C. <br />
<br />
Australia remains in a very warm, dry spell with highs earlier today (it's evening there now) near or above 30 C in the larger cities.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... A few sunny intervals in east and south, becoming mostly overcast later as cloud already spreading into Connacht reaches the rest of the country, followed by outbreaks of sleet or wet snow turning to rain (starting as rain near the west coast), as temperatures slowly recover to more normal values near 7 C in a developing southwesterly wind of 50-70 km/hr. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Any remaining sleet in Leinster or east Ulster turning to rain, with about 5 to 10 mm expected in general before more showery or drizzly conditions develop towards morning, temperatures steady 7 to 9 C, winds west-southwest 50 to 80 km/hr. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Milder for a time with rain or showers, highs near 8 C, possibly reaching 10 C south coast briefly, then turning much colder from the northwest, with snow or sleet showers returning as winds veer to the northwest, with temperatures falling rapidly to near 1 C. Winds west to northwest about 50 to 80 km/hr adding chill especially afternoon and evening. Some heavy snow showers likely in Donegal, and north Connacht.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Windy and cold with passing wintry showers, lows near -2 C and highs near 5 C. Once again turning milder in the evening with sleet turning to rain developing.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Turning milder again with southwest winds 50-70 km/hr and rain at times, highs near 11 C, then much colder late in the day as winds veer to westerly 60-90 km/hr. Wintry showers overnight into Sunday with renewed snow accumulations in the north and west. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY and MONDAY ... Windy and cold with occasional snow or hail showers. Highs about 4 C. Winds generally westerly about 50-70 km/hr.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Windy and milder with rain briefly, but once again, this warm sector will only last a matter of hours before colder air blasts in from the northwest. This next push may be stronger with widespread snow showers likely and temperatures struggling to reach 2 C in bitter northwest winds. <br />
<br />
Further down the road, this cold spell might have a brief milder interval before a change to easterly flow and a brighter, less windy variety of cold with better snow chances for the east coast, although even this pattern itself is not guaranteed yet, as it is not showing on all guidance. Very cold air is filtering into Scandinavia already from northwest Russia and temperatures as low as -35 C have been reported in northern Sweden and Finland, so there is some potent cold air available if the winds do turn in that direction. The Baltic Sea and to some extent parts of the North Sea also are both running warmer than normal which would fill any easterly flow with a lot of moisture. And we have not seen much easterly flow this winter but a &quot;stratospheric warming&quot; event is forecast and this can create blocking at higher latitudes necessary to get the winds into that direction. Let's say the chances are fairly good for a spell of easterly winds, while not a certainty yet.<br />
<br />
My local weather was pleasant (for a change) with the sun making a rare appearance (this is a very sunny location from March to October but winter cloud is the norm due to inversions over the valleys here). It was relatively mild by afternoon reaching 4 C. However, it has begun to snow this evening and we're expecting 20 cms on Wednesday, possibly mixing with rain at times. Avalanche danger is high, a local highway was closed for two days recently while crews cleared a massive snowslide (posted a picture of this in the snow and cold weather thread).<br />
<br />
Snow is developing in the Ohio valley and will spread into the inland northeastern U.S. late today, forecasts are calling for sleet or rain on the coast but 5 to 15 cms of snow inland, and from Boston north along the coast also. <br />
<br />
There is still very little active weather in Australia today, but parts of Japan have received heavy snowfalls in the past few days and it's unusually cold in many parts of east Asia as that huge Siberian high recently split, part of it ended up in Finland and another larger part spread southeast into Mongolia and northeast China. The timing is good as the Winter Olympics begin on Friday in South Korea at a site that needs at least some artificial snow, so a mild spell would not have been great news there.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<i>ALERT for sudden onset (or return) of wintry conditions especially in northern and northwestern counties late afternoon and evening, and to some extent across all other regions, as much colder air accompanied by squally showers turning to hail and snow sweep in with a strong cold front. It will be quite mild until this hits, so be ready, timing is about 2-4 p.m. Donegal and north Connacht, to 7-9 p.m. Leinster and south coast. Temperatures will drop sharply during these intervals and roads may become icy especially in the north and northwest. Shifting gusty winds may challenge drivers so expect that change from west-southwest to northwest if you're on the road during this time.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Milder for a time with rain or showers, highs 8 to 11 C, then turning much colder from the northwest this afternoon west and evening for eastern counties, with thundery showers turning to snow or sleet in many parts of the north and some central and southwestern counties, as winds veer to the northwest, with temperatures then falling rapidly to near 1 C. Winds west to northwest about 50 to 80 km/hr adding chill especially afternoon and evening. Some heavy snow showers likely in Donegal, and north Connacht by evening, 3 to 5 cm accumulations in a few places.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Windy and very cold with passing snow or sleet showers, some with thunder, turning to hail closer to east and south coasts. Lows eventually falling to about -2 C and feeling like -7 C in strong northwest winds 50-80 km/hr. Near-blizzard conditions are possible in higher parts of west Ulster and a few spots in north Connacht.<br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Windy and cold with passing wintry showers, lows near -2 C and highs near 5 C. Once again turning milder in the evening with sleet turning to rain developing.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Turning milder again with southwest winds 50-70 km/hr and rain at times, highs near 11 C, then much colder late in the day as winds veer to westerly 60-90 km/hr. There may be a spell of stronger winds in the north by afternoon as an intense cold front develops, with rain turning to sleet then snow across parts of Ulster and north Connacht. This front may be somewhat less intense further south but there will be a noticeable temperature drop shortly after sunset to near zero degrees C. Wintry showers overnight into Sunday with renewed snow accumulations in the north and west. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY and MONDAY ... Windy and cold with occasional snow or hail showers. Highs about 4 C on Sunday and 7 C on Monday. Frosts both mornings may be rather severe in places with lows -3 to -6 C. Winds generally westerly about 50-70 km/hr.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Windy and slightly milder with rain briefly, highs 6 to 8 C, but once again, this will only last a matter of hours before colder air blasts in from the northwest. This next push may be stronger with widespread snow showers likely and temperatures struggling to reach 2 C, and one source of guidance is now suggesting that the storm track may drop south of Ireland mid-week to produce snowfall chances as lows move past the south coast into southern England, temperatures might be close to 1 C in these mixed precipitation type scenarios with snowfall potential becoming fairly widespread. If this fails to materialize it will likely remain cold and windy from the northwest instead, so either way a fairly similar result just with different wind directions involved. The GFS model has also returned to showing a cold easterly flow in about two weeks, something it was doing earlier but dropped for a time on Wednesday's updates. This still seems to be about a one in three chance perhaps, and alternatives might not be a lot milder either, but other models have less output past ten days so it's hard to compare; also that stratospheric warming event looms as a big wild card, whether it's cause or effect of the blocking, it seems equally hard to predict with precision. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday was somewhat of a near miss with heavy snow up to our north but only light snow locally, with temperatures steady near 1 C, perhaps 8 cms fell eventually and it's still coming down rather sporadically; 45 cms fell across parts of central B.C. in the past day. The sloppy mess that hit the northeastern U.S. has moved into eastern Canada tonight leaving the door open for colder temperatures there. <br />
<br />
Conditions remain similar to previous days in Australia with most populated areas having a warm, dry day but some cloud has pushed into Victoria state and the tropical thunderstorms look a bit more intense over the Darwin region at the present time.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />

<br />
TODAY ... Windy and cold with passing wintry showers, with snow less frequent in the mix by afternoon, sleet or hail more likely then, but all through that some sunny intervals as well with temperatures slowly rising to about 5 or 6 C by late afternoon with the last of any sleet turning to rain by early evening, winds backing to southwest and increasing to 70-100 km/hr, some strong gusts near west coast by evening.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Windy with 5-10 mm rainfalls, winds southwest 70-100 km/hr, temperatures continuing to edge upwards towards 9 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Windy and mild although in the strong winds not feeling all that warm, temperatures steady near 10 C, rain easing to showers but squally at times with hail. There may be an interval of very strong winds especially through central counties mid-afternoon, details on this may change so stay tuned as it could be briefly severe (gusts to 120 km/hr possible). It will then turn much colder as winds veer rapidly to northwest 70-100 km/hr with wintry showers returning by evening, temperatures about 2 C by then.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Windy and very cold with snow showers likely, 1 to 3 cm accumulations in some places (3 to 6 cm higher ground northwest), winds westerly 60 to 90 km/hr and temperatures steady 2 to 5 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Windy and cold with intervals of sleet likely, some snow accumulations on hills, despite southerly winds 50-80 km/hr (and another interval of very strong winds possible), highs near 6 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Rain or sleet, snow on hills, in northeast winds as low pressure forms to the south, but not quite enough cold air feeding in to make this a snowfall event (at present reading anyway), highs near 7 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Very windy and cold with showers of sleet, hail and snow developing in gale to storm force southwest winds 70-120 km/hr (strongest winds in north and west). Temperatures steady near 7 C but falling off during heavier bouts of wintry showers. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Very unsettled and rather cold once this mid-week windstorm situation passes, little change in the slightly below normal temperature trend. The longer term indications remain very unclear beyond next week with cold influences from east and northwest seeming to want to battle for dominance, but either way it will probably stay quite cold. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Thursday was foggy with light rain and a high near 2 C, some snow fell at times last night but the system then weakened and is now falling apart as colder air pushes in from the north. A snowfall of 10-20 cms has developed over much of the lower Great Lakes region from a frontal boundary that is bringing arctic air of about -10 C up against much milder Pacific air masses near 10 C in the Ohio valley and central plains states. This will push into northern New England over the weekend leaving the east coast in the milder air mass for several days. <br />
<br />
Australia remains largely dry and sunny, although rather cloudy around Sydney in the past few hours.</div>

<br />
<i>ALERT for strong winds and localized heavy rainfall by this afternoon and evening ...<br />
 the strong winds would most likely develop from about Mayo-Galway east to Meath-Dublin and would be less of a factor near the south coast although moderately strong in all other counties. Peak gusts could be 100 km/hr to as high as 120 km/hr depending on how well-organized this front becomes (guidance is quite spread out). The heavy rainfall will be found to the north of the strong wind zone, from north/central Mayo east towards southeast Ulster, including Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan. Local amounts of 30-40 mm are possible, considerably less is expected further south and somewhat less to the north of this zone ... also, advance alert for snow accumulations in Connacht and Ulster by Sunday morning, 3-5 cms especially on higher ground seems likely, scattered 1-3 cm covering is possible elsewhere although not in all locations. ... I hope to update this alert for strong winds and heavy rainfall before 6 p.m., as the situation will develop rather quickly close to landfall.</i><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Breezy to windy and milder than recent days, passing showers could be locally heavy and squally, in particular south Connacht to central Leinster. Winds generally westerly 50-70 km/hr could briefly gust higher with hail and thunder possible. Highs near 11 C. Becoming very windy in south Connacht and later in north-central Leinster with outbreaks of heavy rain from north Connacht to southeast Ulster. Details in the alert above. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Turning sharply colder around sunset in west coast counties, and during the later evening near the east coast, as winds turn northwesterly 50-70 km/hr after the above mentioned interval of strong winds. Rain turning to sleet and then snow across parts of the north with eventual accumulations (mainly on higher terrain) of about 5 cms. Scattered 1-3 cm snowfalls further south by morning. Lows near -1 C but feeling closer to -7 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Windy and cold with passing snow showers, more of a wintry mix near sea level by afternoon but snow showers persisting on higher ground, accumulations coming and going with partial melting in between heavy showers. Highs 3 to 6 C. Winds westerly 50-70 km/hr. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Windy, mixed wintry showers or sleet turning to rain for a time in the evening, then that will turn back to sleet and snow overnight, as winds become strong south to southwest 70-110 km/hr, veering westerly and easing overnight. Morning lows near -2 C inland, and highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Variable cloud, outbreaks of rain or sleet at times, becoming quite windy again later in the day (south to southwest 50-80 km/hr), lows 1 to 3 C and highs 6 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Very windy with squally showers, some mixed wintry showers developing later as winds veer from south-southwest 70-110 km/hr to west-southwest 60-90 km/hr. Lows near 2 C and highs near 7 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... It seems likely to remain quite unsettled, breezy to windy at times, and somewhat colder than average, and there is about a one in three chance of an easterly spell of winds bringing quite cold towards Ireland's east coast, but this is only supported by some of the global models, others maintain a cool westerly sort of regime. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Friday turned very windy in the early morning hours, northerly winds get channelled down the nearby lake and we had strong gusts for a few hours as colder air arrived. The day was cloudy and cold, still a bit windy, with occasional snowflakes but no new accumulations. Our recent messy wet snow surfaces have frozen and there's ice where slush had accumulated. Heavy snow continued most of the day from Chicago to Detroit to Toronto, rather localized but 20-30 cms in some places. Milder air is spreading east to the south of that disturbance. <br />
<br />
In Australia, warm and dry weather continues for many but cloud has spread into border areas between Victoria and New South Wales, and there are scattered heavy thunderstorms in north-central WA state, not affecting Perth however. <br />
<br />
Watch for updates between 5 and 6 p.m. on today's late afternoon severe weather risks.</div>

___________________________________<br />
<br />
Low pressure is gradually developing over western counties at this time, which may mean that the strongest wind gusts will occur over eastern counties later this evening. There is still some time available for strong gusts to develop in Galway (some reports around 80 km/hr already) but more likely for gusts over 100 km/hr would be Dublin and Meath by about 9-10 p.m. ... as this zone of strong winds expands through central counties in the next two hours, gusts to about 90 km/hr are likely in east Galway, Roscommon, Offaly, north Tipps and later into Kildare and Westmeath. Gusts to about 110 km/hr are possible in Dublin, Kildare and Meath later this evening. <br />
<br />
There is also a slight risk of a gusty thunderstorm further south along a developing frontal boundary that is currently in northeast Cork and western Tipperary; this may produce a few strong gusts and hail in counties of the inland southeast this evening.<br />
<br />
As to the rainfall alert, most of that rain has already fallen except in the eastern half of the country where northern sections still have about 10 mm left to fall, amounts further south more like 5 mm additional. Watch for some flooded roadways in Connacht (central Galway at least, according to reports on the event discussion thread). Amounts have been heavy from about Newport to Cavan.</div>

<br />
<i>ALERT for outbreaks of snow, sleet or hail that may make driving difficult at times, more frequently in higher parts of the west and north, but not confined only to those regions, as wintry showers could develop anywhere, accompanied by some thunder at times. Strong winds will complicate the driving challenges and so will brief intervals of dazzling sunshine.</i><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Windy and very cold with outbreaks of snow, sleet or hail, roads may become slippery and in some places icy, and higher parts of Connacht and Ulster could experience white-out conditions at times with 3-5 cm snowfall potential. Other parts of the country may see occasional coatings of 1-2 cm snow or heavy deposits of hail. West to northwest winds 60-90 km/hr (higher gusts in west coast exposed locations) and highs only 2 to 6 C, feeling more like -4 C in the strong winds. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Continued rather windy and very cold, wintry showers more confined to north and west, lows near -2 C inland. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Breezy to windy and while still cold, somewhat milder by afternoon when snow or sleet should be mostly confined to higher elevations and rain will develop, although turning to snow on hills, in strong south to southwest winds that may peak around 70-110 km/hr by evening. Temperatures will continue to climb back slowly towards 7 or 8 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Windy and colder for the first part of the day with snow showers, then as winds back to southerly, rain may develop especially over northwestern counties, with moderate south to southwest winds 50-80 km/hr by evening. Lows near 1 C and highs near 8 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Windy and somewhat milder for the morning hours, then turning colder by afternoon and evening. Very strong winds could brush outer coasts of Connacht and Ulster but for most, expect southwesterly 60-90 km/hr, with intervals of rain turning more to sleet or wet snow in some higher locations by late in the day.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY and FRIDAY are looking quite cold with passing wintry showers, moderate westerly winds, highs about 5 or 6 C. <br />
<br />
By the end of the week, we are basically confronted with two different outcomes, with one group of global models indicating a blocking high pushing back against the weak Atlantic flow and taking over in the last week of the month, with some very wintry looking maps on offer for the end of February. Confidence is naturally low on that outcome this far out but it does blend with the earlier ideas being floated around in forecasting circles about an impending stratospheric warming event. However, other guidance just shows the weak and chilly Atlantic flow persisting into that final week. So it's a &quot;battle of the models&quot; and all we can do is pull up a chair and watch. <br />
<br />
My local weather was entirely clear for the whole day, which is probably the first time since we made our move to this new location, and we had spectacular views of the heavy new snowfalls that happened on local mountain slopes from our recent rainy and foggy spell &quot;down below.&quot; It was quite cold with a northerly wind and highs of about -2 C. The weather in eastern North America continues to set up a battleground with snow around Illinois and Michigan, sleet further south and east, and rain moving up from the Gulf states towards the northeast coastal cities where this week will be rather mild and foggy (highs in New York City for example about 8 to 11 C). <br />
<br />
Nothing too dramatic happening in Australia, will resume those reports when the summer produces any active weather.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Breezy to windy, sunny intervals with passing wintry showers, and while still cold this morning, turning somewhat milder by afternoon when any remnant snow or sleet showers should be mostly confined to higher elevations and rain will develop in strong south to southwest winds that may peak around 70-110 km/hr by evening. Temperatures will continue to climb back slowly towards 7 or 8 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Rain will end with an interval of sleet or snow that might require a forecast update later this afternoon, as conditions appear marginally favourable for some accumulations in parts of Leinster overnight, with clearing further west, as winds ease and shift more to a westerly direction 40-60 km/hr. Lows by morning will be close to 1 C.<br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Windy and colder for the first part of the day with snow showers, then as winds back to southerly, rain may develop especially over northwestern counties, with moderate south to southwest winds 50-80 km/hr by evening. Lows near 1 C and highs near 8 C. Rain will be more persistent Tuesday night in strong south to southwest winds 50-80 km/hr.<br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Windy and somewhat milder for the morning hours, then turning colder by afternoon and evening. Very strong winds could brush outer coasts of Connacht and Ulster but for most, expect southwesterly 60-90 km/hr, with intervals of rain turning more to sleet or wet snow in some higher locations by late in the day.<br />
Lows near 5 C and highs near 8 C.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY and FRIDAY are looking quite cold with passing wintry showers, moderate westerly winds, highs about 5 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
The weekend of 17th-18th and perhaps several days after that will be influenced by building high pressure, this is a slight change from the easterly scenario that was discussed yesterday and all guidance seems to favour this now so it tends to be a compromise between those formerly different outcomes, so while it will be rather cold under this high pressure, with sharp frosts likely, there won't be enough of an easterly flow as it now appears to create much potential for wintry showers on the east coast. The situation beyond this period of settled weather is quite uncertain and could still go either way (back to milder southwesterly flow, or eventually more of a draw from the east if this high were to drift back out to the west towards the end of the month). <br />
<br />
My local weather was partly cloudy and cold with highs only reaching -2 C, and it's clear and very cold at the present time.</div>

		<div>UPDATE __ Mon 12 Feb 2018 __ 10 p.m.<br />
____________________________________<br />
<br />
A front now crossing Ireland seems to be developing some small-scale ripples or &quot;meso-scale lows&quot; that will tend to produce additional sleet or (mostly at higher elevations) snow in a few locations this evening and past midnight for the southeast. One such feature has developed over Mayo and there is potential for 3-5 cm snowfalls on higher ground in north Connacht and later through most of Ulster if that feature continues to track east. I am watching for similar development around 11 p.m. in the inland southeast that could produce a burst of heavy sleet or wet snowfall especially over the higher parts of Wicklow and north Wexford. Your best bet is to watch reports on the forum thread discussing the current cold spell and snowfall, as this could develop over a short time frame. Having said that, I think there's going to be quite a few places where the event ends with rain turning to sleet for a short time then clearing, and in terms of population rather than area, that might be more the case. <br />
<br />
One other note of interest is that the GFS model has returned to showing a significant easterly spell in about ten days time, so that back and forth continues, will have a closer look at that in the morning forecast. Local weather is glorious sunshine, not even a contrail in sight.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Windy and cold with a few outbreaks of snow or sleet, more likely in the west and north but not exclusively there, with the potential for 1 to 3 cm brief covering of snow, some icy roads as a result. There will also be some sunny intervals in the mix, and later on more of a wintry mix of showers as highs reach about 4 to 6 C in gusty westerly winds 50 to 80 km/hr. By late afternoon and evening, these winds will have backed into a south to southwest direction and some outbreaks of rain are likely as temperatures will remain steady, but sleet could develop on higher ground in the north ahead of the milder air.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Windy with intervals of rain, temperatures steady 5 to 7 C, winds south to southwest 60 to 90 km/hr. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY ... Rain becoming more showery during the morning, peak temperatures likely around 10 a.m. to noon (8 to 11 C) when winds will begin to veer more westerly, then temperatures slowly falling during the afternoon to 4 or 5 C with showers becoming somewhat wintry again at least in higher parts of the west and north. Very strong gusts are possible but may stay off the northwest coast. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Partly cloudy, passing wintry showers, cold. Morning lows -1 to +2 C and afternoon highs 4 to 7 C. Winds westerly 50 to 80 km/hr. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Sunny intervals, isolated showers, some wintry on hills, not as windy, lows -2 to +2 C and highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
WEEKEND OUTLOOK ... Generally settled weather for the weekend as higher pressure builds up over Ireland, some sunny intervals both days, morning frosts, and highs near 7 or 8 C. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... All guidance now agrees a colder easterly spell will develop as the weekend high drifts off to the north and northwest, and temperatures will fall back to near freezing in the daytime and -6 C or lower at night if the current set of maps is correct, with potential for snow in eastern counties, in particular around Thursday or Friday (22nd-23rd). This is not a guaranteed outcome yet, but with all global models showing similar outcomes, we can say that there is moderate confidence in this wintry outlook. What is less certain is how long that spell might last once it arrives, the one model that goes past ten days has it breaking down within a few days but that is really a low confidence forecast at this stage. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Monday was sunny and rather cold with highs near -1 C, snow cover basically frozen at the surface and roads bare and dry but some ice where slush from last week has frozen. The weather pattern across North America has gone relatively quiet, we're expecting an increase in cloud all day Tuesday followed by about 5 to 10 cm of new snow Tuesday night.</div>

<br />
TODAY ... Rain becoming more showery during the morning, strong south to southwest winds 70-110 km/hr, and peak temperatures likely around 10 a.m. to noon (8 to 11 C) when winds will begin to veer more westerly, then temperatures slowly falling during the afternoon to 4 or 5 C (faster in western and northern counties) with showers becoming somewhat wintry again at least in higher parts of the west and north. Winds easing slightly by late afternoon to westerly 60-90 km/hr.<br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Continued windy but cold with passing wintry showers, some accumulations of snow in north and west, lows -1 to +2 C. Winds west-southwest at 50 to 80 km/hr in exposed coastal areas, but less blustery inland.<br />
<br />
THURSDAY ... Partly cloudy, passing wintry showers, cold. Morning lows -1 to +2 C and afternoon highs 4 to 7 C. Winds westerly 50 to 80 km/hr. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Sunny intervals, isolated showers, some wintry on hills, not as windy, lows -2 to +2 C and highs 5 to 8 C. <br />
<br />
WEEKEND OUTLOOK ... Generally settled weather for the weekend as higher pressure builds up over Ireland, some sunny intervals both days, morning frosts, and highs near 7 or 8 C. Low cloud and drizzle may brush the northwest coasts at times but skies will tend to remain partly cloudy if not clear at times in the south, so that frosts will be more likely in the inland south than further north. Winds over the weekend will be moderate southwest at times in the north, less windy to near calm at night in the south.<br />
<br />
NEXT WEEK ... This spell of quiet and seasonable weather could last for several more days, but eventually it appears that the high will drift away, most likely to the west, allowing more of a northeast wind flow to develop, and this may permit very cold air lurking not too far away in Scandinavia (by then) to move west at least into Britain and probably also into Ireland at some point around the following weekend (24th-25th). If there's going to be a spell of wintry weather for eastern Ireland, it would most likely happen around that weekend or in the last three days of February. I don't expect a lot of clarity on this forecast scenario for several days yet. Something entirely different could replace it, there's a lot of moving parts and the usual tendency of models to &quot;chop and change&quot; these outcomes several times, meaning that the colder spell could begin a bit earlier or later than described, as well as just not coming to fruition. I would say the chances of a cold spell are about even at this point (meaning 50-50). It's not unusual for the models to disagree quite strongly about cold spells at this time range. <br />
<br />
My local weather turned cloudy during Tuesday and stayed quite cold (-2 C) then snow began around late afternoon and has continued with 15 cms on the ground so far, looks like another 5 or so could fall then clearing up again and staying cold.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Frequent wintry showers may drop snow or sleet at times, but it can also rain as temperatures fluctuate between 2 and 6 C, with hail also in the mix. Some sunny breaks will occur between the showers and a few places might have longer sunny spells, most likely in the lee of mountains in the south and southeast as winds will remain blustery from the west at 50-70 km/hr. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Some remnant snow showers but clearing gradually in parts of the east and south to allow some frost, lows -2 to +2 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, not quite as cold, a few showers but amounts generally less than 2 mm, highs 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Some rain at times, mostly near west coast and across Ulster and north midlands, but eventually a few outbreaks in the south as well, highs reaching about 10 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Partly cloudy and mild, highs 10 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY to WEDNESDAY will continue settled and rather mild at least in western counties, there may be a slight downward trend in temperatures for the inland south and most of the east, but highs will remain generally at least 8 C if not 10 to 12 C in the west, and there should be decent amounts of sunshine and only a few very isolated showers if any rain at all. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK ... We are back to the &quot;battle of the models&quot; as the European model seems to want nothing to do with colder air moving west or south towards Ireland, in fact this model returns to rather mild southwesterly patterns after the consensus of high pressure early next week, whereas North American models are quite consistent with easterly flow developing some time between mid-week and the end of next week, then that lasting a few days but coming into conflict with returning milder air trying to push it back into Britain and central northern Europe. If I had a time machine or a crystal ball I could say which outcome is right (maybe none of them are?) but we haven't seen a cold easterly spell yet this winter really, so maybe that's the sentimental favourite.<br />
<br />
My local weather saw the heavy snowfall ending before dawn, then slow and partial clearing with temperatures steady around -1 C. We had a nice new covering of 20 cms which has returned our overall snow depth to 35 cms for now and cleaned up the appearance of the huge snowbanks all around the town from the non-stop snow clearance operations in the past month (we have some snowbanks over 20 feet high in some places). Going up into the higher elevations on Thursday to see how it looks up there after what was likely 30 cms new snow, may win a Darwin award for this.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the South Pacific, severe cyclone (hurricane) Gita is now south of Fiji, after doing considerable damage on the 12th in Tonga. This cat-4 (Australian system) 950 mb storm is moving due west and has missed most of Fiji although it gave one small outlying island a lashing yesterday. I'll keep an eye on its future course as these sometimes recurve southeast towards New Zealand. The damage in Tonga included flattening parliament buildings, if you've ever seen the Tongan rugby team you'll know that they are safe.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<i>The main story in the forecast today as for the past few days is not so much the upcoming few days of mild, rather bland weather, but the possibility of a sharp turn to colder weather mid-week and now the models are somewhat more in agreement on this, in fact the most reluctant to show this outcome (the European) has taken a lead position in its latest runs. This is not yet a certain outcome but we need to be aware of the potential for sub-freezing cold and east coast (and Ulster) snow if this comes to pass as very cold air is shown making a strong run across Britain towards Ireland by this time next week.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Becoming mostly cloudy, outbreaks of light rain, highs 7 to 10 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Fog patches, partial clearing, local frost possible, lows -1 to +3 C. Watch for icy stretches of road in some rural areas. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Variable cloud, rain developing near south and west coasts by afternoon, spreading north overnight. Highs 8 to 11 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY and MONDAY appear likely to be quite mild with intervals of drizzle or light rain but also some sunny breaks, and highs 10 to 13 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY will begin to turn colder, probably with northerly winds developing at first, then light to moderate northeast, highs near 7 C.<br />
<br />
OUTLOOK is for colder weather, details yet to be established, but with potential for each day to Friday or Saturday being a bit colder in turn, eventually some sharp to severe night frosts and daytime readings -1 to +4 C possible, east winds and local snow near east coast in the mix if this spell turns sufficiently cold. <br />
<br />
My local weather was once again quite pleasant although cold, with temperatures in our valley near -2 C, and as we found by taking a day trip, -7 C in the next valley east, a common occurrence when it's bitterly cold east of the Rockies (there is one more valley as we have three mountain ranges between us and Alberta, pity it's not more but what can you do?) ... saw a bizarre contrail on this day trip, breaking up from the usual appearance of two parallel lines behind the jet, to multiple intricate patterns, have attached a photo of it ... don't think I've ever seen one quite like this but I'm thinking it is caused by the wave action of stable air crossing these high mountain ranges (plane at probably 25,000' heading east and local ranges peak near 10,000'). Clear skies are slowly clouding up overnight for another light snow event over Friday-Saturday. <br />
<br />
That cyclone in the South Pacific (Gita) is now off the south tip of Nouvelle-Caledonie and weakening slowly. In response, a frontal zone in eastern Australia seems to have bubbled up a number of heavy thunderstorms around Brisbane and Townsville further north on the Queensland coast.</div>

No clear solutions yet so the choice at the moment seems to be between modified colder weather with slight frosts and daytime highs 4 to 7 C, or the more severe form of cold still prominent on some models again this morning, with the risk of snow in eastern and northern counties by late next week. <br />
<br />
These different outcomes are dependent on whether high pressure forming near Ireland around Monday-Tuesday will be the dominant feature, or whether it will get linked up into stronger and much colder arctic high pressure that some guidance places over north-central Scandinavia. This has to follow a rather complicated sequence of events involving high pressure currently very close to the north pole moving across into northern Russia in the next four days. So we are basically waiting to see what happens with this, if the pressure starts to rise steadily around Murmansk and Helsinki next week, then this very cold spell becomes a strong possibility. If things remain less dramatic (average sort of cold weather for that region) then the west European high will probably be all we have to work with, and it needs to link up to something further east to get any sort of really wintry conditions to move west. <br />
<br />
My local weather produced 5 to 8 cms of snow during the morning and that continued as light flurries up to the present time, with heavier snow about ready to begin for most of Saturday (expecting about 20 cms more now). The temperature has been close to zero C all day. In eastern North America, some very mild weather has come and gone in the past two days and it's getting back to more average mid- February temperatures now although remaining largely dry.<br />
<br />
Cyclone &quot;Gita&quot; in the South Pacific appears to be weakening almost below hurricane strength now and has started to recurve south, later southeast to brush past the northern tip of New Zealand by Monday or so. Looks like there is also tropical cyclone activity near the north coast of Western Australia.</div>

<i>The risk of severe cold and snow remains on the table (meaning on the charts) for the period 25th to 28th February and possibly on into early March. Some guidance has this starting up a day or two earlier than other models suggest, but we're getting a moderate amount of agreement, although details are significantly different. The fact that the leading model (ECM) is showing the most severe cold is getting a lot of attention around the weather community (yes we exist, we are your neighbours, your co-workers, perhaps the person you see in the mirror). </i><br />
<br />
<br />
TODAY ... Rain will gradually spread east, 10 to 15 mm will fall in many places by late afternoon, and there will be slow clearing from the west towards mid-afternoon but rain will taper to drizzle for the east coast and only end towards evening there. Highs 10 to 12 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Fog patches, drizzle at times in east, mild, lows 5 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Variable cloud, some sunny breaks around mid-day, light rain at times by later afternoon and evening, highs near 11 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Drizzle or fog clearing, some sunny breaks developing as colder north winds develop, morning lows 3 to 6 C and afternoon highs 7 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY to FRIDAY appears likely to be a set-up period for colder weather to come, so while it will turn a bit colder with slight frosts, this won't be the main cold spell that may be coming along later. Highs 5 to 8 C and overnight lows -2 to +2 C with slight frosts and southeast winds, chance of some drizzle at times near outer west coast as the Atlantic will be trying to hold back the westward push of colder air from north-central Europe. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... Either we see a very cold easterly spell with possible snow in eastern and northern counties, or it's some sort of battleground scenario developing with batches of colder air pushing west against milder Atlantic air masses holding on to some ground near the west and south coasts. Details are scattered in this range on various global models but we hope to be seeing clearer indications of how severe this spell might become by Tuesday or so. Some of the maps would indicate potential for freezing temperatures throughout the day, -8 C overnight readings and considerable amounts of snow near the east coast and in most parts of Ulster, patchy lighter snow reaching other locations further west. There seems to be at least a 50-50 chance that this degree of cold will be reached some time around Monday 26th, but we cannot guarantee this yet. <br />
<br />
My local weather was snowy all day on Saturday with about 15 cms added on to the already considerable snow pack here. It was about -2 C with a light north wind feeding in from very cold air parked to our north waiting to flood in here on Sunday afternoon once this snowstorm pushes off into Montana. <br />
<br />
Tropical Cyclone Gita has made a rather wide turn and is passing between Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island (two offshore parts of NSW, Australia) on its way to the west coast of New Zealand, where it may be closer to South Island than North Island while dying out around Tuesday or so. It is already quite a bit weaker than when it was south of Fiji a few days ago, looks like a tropical storm on the satellite imagery rather than a hurricane at this point. It is now moving almost due south but making quite a wide sweep of the Tasman Sea compared to most of this group's last stages.</div>

TODAY ... Mostly cloudy and misty to start, some brighter intervals developing around late morning, with scattered outbreaks of light rain following by afternoon (2 to 5 mm expected). Highs 10 to 13 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Drizzle and fog at times, lows 3 to 6 C. <br />
<br />
TUESDAY ... Gradual clearing, cooler. Light to moderate northerly breezes. Highs about 8 C. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY and THURSDAY will feature some sunshine each day with morning frosts and fog patches, and it will be rather cold although some west coast locations may warm up to around 10 C, otherwise highs about 6 to 8 C, and morning lows about -2 to +1 C. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY and next WEEKEND are likely to see increasing southeasterly winds and a slight drop in temperatures each day, reaching about 4 C by Sunday. There will likely be considerable cloud and some brief sunny breaks, morning fog patches and slight frosts. <br />
<br />
If colder weather follows as some guidance continues to depict, winds will be brisk easterly and there could be snow near the east and south coasts as well as in parts of Ulster. This colder spell may push temperatures as low as -1 C in the daytime but this is not locked in yet, there is an equal chance that the readings will stay about the same as the weekend (4 to 6 C) with less chance for snow. I am hoping this situation will become clearer through model consensus by mid-week but sometimes these wintry spells leave us uncertain until much closer to &quot;show time&quot; (or snow time?). If severe cold does develop, Monday 26th to the first few days of March would appear to be the time frame. <br />
<br />
My local weather on Sunday was bright and cold although rather cloudy, the sun trying to get through dense higher level cloud layers, but no further snowfall, and highs only -3 C. Some wet snow has fallen in parts of the northeast U.S. over the weekend, followed by colder weather there.</div>

Forecasts for Ireland</b><br />
<br />
<b><i>ADVANCE ALERT -- A spell of severe winter weather is now considered very likely starting around Sunday 25th and lasting perhaps a week or longer. Details are of course sketchy but the depth of cold air apparently heading west towards Ireland would suggest that temperatures could be well below freezing, and that snowfall is a strong possibility in the east, south and perhaps coastal areas of north and west as well, and we are seeing some charts on the most reliable models that are real jaw-droppers for snowfall potential, so be aware and check for updates, there is still a slight chance of a less intense outcome but with all global models marching in lock-step towards this scenario, confidence is growing.</i></b><br />
<br />
<br />
The overall situation is that the very mild air mass from the past two days has been pushed east of Ireland now by a slowly developing high pressure area, but some of that milder air will get trapped between this weak cold air mass and the advancing Siberian very cold air, and will be returned to sender (the Atlantic) later this week.<br />
<br />
The weather sequence expected is roughly as follows:<br />
<br />
TODAY will be sunny with cloudy intervals, isolated sprinkles of rain possible near north facing coasts, and highs 7 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT will have clear skies to start, with some increase in cloud, mist and fog later on. Lows of -2 to +2 C will occur rather early before sunrise, and some roads may be rather slippery in the morning commute. <br />
<br />
WEDNESDAY to FRIDAY will see more cloud than clear skies, generally, with spotty outbreaks of drizzle or light rain, in light southeast winds that will gradually become moderate by Friday. Highs each day 6 to 8 C and lows generally 1 to 4 C but could drop below freezing where skies clear briefly.<br />
<br />
SATURDAY could see a gradual drop in temperature if the faster guidance is correct, in terms of colder air arriving from the east. But there is probably an equal chance of it staying similar to the days previous, with the temperature drop delayed to Sunday. For now, we'll say variable cloud and moderate east to southeast winds, possible drizzle or light sleety rain near east coast, highs 4 to 7 C. <br />
<br />
SUNDAY is more likely to be turning colder in stages with temperatures falling sharply by afternoon and evening as stronger east winds develop (40 to 60 km/hr) adding quite a chill to temperatures around 2 to 5 C. <br />
<br />
MONDAY to WEDNESDAY (26 to 28 Feb) are now looking very likely to be &quot;Baltic&quot; as the expression goes, in fact that's pretty much where the winds will originate, with some variations in direction between southeast and northeast as weak troughs develop in the arctic easterly flow. Temperatures will probably be well below normal with highs -2 to +2 C and lows -7 to -3 C, higher readings where these winds have just come in from the ocean or Irish Sea, lower readings well inland. Heavy snow showers are quite possible especially near east and south coasts, won't speculate on amounts yet but disruptive potential. <br />
<br />
FURTHER OUTLOOK calls for this wintry spell to continue with the European model showing potential for a heavy snowfall around 1-2 March, stay tuned as these details could change, but in any event, it appears likely that the cold spell will get one or two reinforcements from the east, with only limited amounts of warming between the coldest spells. If it does snow heavily in some areas and then clears, temperatures could drop well below -8 C over snow in clear skies. The overall effects of this spell could be quite disruptive to travel. (The chances appear to be at least 70 per cent that some form of wintry weather will occur, whether it lasts as long as some guidance suggests might be more like 40 per cent probable). <br />
<br />
My local weather was like the above, a very cold day here with a piercing north wind blowing down the lake but mostly sunny with highs near -6 C, dazzling reflections off the fresh snow cover. The wacky weather continues in eastern North America, where they went from 20 C late last week to snow and now back to 15 C on Monday, with another cold spell looming.</div>

<br />
<i>The risk of severe cold next week now appears to be just the opening phase of what could be quite a long cold spell, and there should be enough clear skies on some nights to guarantee that some particularly low overnight temperatures will develop during this spell. The chances for snow are more difficult to assess, there are various scenarios in different global models that could produce snow in parts of Ireland, and Leinster, east Ulster, and the south coast probably have the higher risks. We don't expect a lot of clarity on snow potential until the cold air settles in, frankly the models seem to be taking small clues and amplifying their significance but that's not to say the overall idea of a significant cold spell is faulty, just the details on offer (still six or seven days away).</i><br />
<br />
TODAY will have some morning fog and mist patches, with sunny spells to follow, but a general increase in cloud during the day, and with light southeast winds the morning chill may not quickly dissipate, but eventually highs will reach 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT will bring mostly cloudy skies but any clear patches in north Leinster or east Ulster might promote local frost and fog, otherwise expect lows 2 to 5 C. <br />
<br />
THURSDAY and FRIDAY will be similar days, partly cloudy, mostly dry, with moderate southeast winds, milder in the Atlantic coastal counties than further east, with highs 8 to 10 C west, 5 to 7 C east, and slight frosts each morning inland, but lows around coastal and urban areas just above freezing. Winds southeast 40 to 70 km/hr will sometimes feel rather cold. <br />
<br />
WEEKEND OUTLOOK ... There is some uncertainty on the timing but most of the weekend will continue to be transitional as the current cool dry air mass awaits eviction by the stronger westward-moving very cold air from Russia. So it seems most probable that the weekend will feature highs near 6 C and slight to perhaps moderate frosts each morning, with winds remaining southeast 40 to 70 km/hr. There could be some sunshine each day but eventually more cloud by late Sunday with chance of sleety drizzle as colder air arrives.<br />
<br />
NEXT WEEK looks very cold with frequent dry spells and wintry sunshine, but the ongoing risk of localized snow especially in Leinster, coastal south, and east Ulster. Further west, not quite as severe and less chance of wintry showers at first. This severe cold will be accompanied by east winds 50 to 80 km/hr at times, although inland more like 30 to 50 km/hr. Daily highs will be in the range of -1 to +3 C and overnight lows by Tuesday could be as low as -9 C inland, -4 C in more temperate coastal areas. Later on, towards 1-2 March, winds may turn more northeasterly at times with passing disturbances dropping snow or sleet. <br />
<br />
This cold spell could dig in and continue for quite a long stretch, with perhaps the odd brief interruption by a day closer to March normal temperatures, and it seems logical to suggest that the longer this spell continues, the more likelihood there would be for snow to affect your location, as it would be only a matter of time until the right combination of wind direction, frontal systems and temperature occur. However, we remember that March 2013 was generally quite cold and rather dry in quite a few places so that outcome is also possible. <br />
<br />
My local weather has continued cold and dry with some mist from the open waters of local lakes in -7 C temperatures. Across the lower Great Lakes, very mild with flooding rainfalls on Tuesday, and this low appears headed northeast towards Quebec and eventually near western Greenland due to the large blocking high developing over Iceland next week.</div>

<b><i>The risk of severe winter weather conditions next week has actually been upgraded with the latest guidance, but it's too early to be absolutely sure these outcomes will happen in full. Some maps including those provided by the leading European model would add heavy snowfalls to the more certain prospect of intense cold by mid-week. Take this alert and the material in the following forecasts more as a guide of what could potentially happen than anything certain to happen. </i></b><br />
<br />
TODAY ... Mostly cloudy, spots of drizzle near west coast, otherwise dry, moderate southeast breezes at times, highs 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
TONIGHT ... Partly cloudy, except overcast near west coast, lows 2 to 5 C. Some clear intervals in north Leinster and east Ulster could allow slight frosts to develop there. <br />
<br />
FRIDAY ... Partly cloudy, moderate southeast winds 40-60 km/hr, highs 6 to 9 C. <br />
<br />
SATURDAY ... Morning lows zero to 3 C, then partly cloudy to overcast, a little milder in west where highs 8-10 C, staying rather cool further east with highs 5 to 8 C. Winds south to southeast 40 to 60 km/hr.<br />
<br />
SUNDAY ... Sunny intervals, lows -2 to +3 C, highs 5 to 8 C. Winds increasing at times to southeast 50 to 80 km/hr. <br />
<br />
MONDAY ... Variable cloud, turning sharply colder during the day, possible snow or sleet showers by late afternoon or evening near south and east coasts. Morning lows about -1 C and afternoon highs only 3 to 6 C east, 5 to 8 C west. Winds east-southeast 50 to 80 km/hr. <br />
<br />
OUTLOOK ... A severe cold spell is very likely from about Tuesday 27th into early March. Winds during this period will be mostly from the east and could back to northeast at times. There may be intervals of snow especially near south and east coasts, in most of Ulster, and at times in other regions, and some guidance suggests the potential for heavy snow around 28th February to 2nd of March, accompanied by strong winds. Temperatures will likely fall slightly below freezing at times, and if skies clear at night, could reach -8 C quite easily overnight, but it may become more of a wind and snow scenario which would keep temperatures rather steady. These details will be ironed out closer to the time, but be aware of the potential for very disruptive conditions by Wednesday 28th. This cold spell may continue well into March with slight relaxation of the cold at times, but further chances for snowfall too.<br />
<br />
My local weather on Wednesday was overcast and very cold with highs no better than about -7 C, and in the general area people were reporting overnight lows below -20 C.</div>
